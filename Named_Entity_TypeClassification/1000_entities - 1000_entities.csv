PSA,PDU Session Anchor,Network Function,V,"This procedure allows for Ethernet PDU Sessions to change the PDU Session Anchor (PSA) while the session remains set up. Originally the Ethernet PDU Session goes via the Source UPF acting as the PSA. The Ethernet context which contains all Ethernet specific information including the MAC address of the UE and possibly its VLAN tag(s) is reported from the Source PSA UPF to the SMF. It is possible to report multiple MAC addresses (with their VLAN tag(s)) if these are reachable via the UE. The SMF determines whether and when a serving PDU Session anchor for an Ethernet PDU Session needs to be changed and selects the Target PSA UPF, establishes the N4 session at the Target PSA UPF. The information within the Ethernet context is sent to the Target UPF. Based on the information in the Ethernet context, the Target PSA UPF may take action to update the Ethernet forwarding in the data network. Figure 4.3.5.8-1: Ethernet PDU Session Anchor Relocation Initially, the Ethernet PDU Session is established with the user data going via the Source UPF. The Source UPF acts as the PSA. 1. The Source UPF reports the Ethernet context which contains all Ethernet specific information including the MAC address of the UE and possibly its VLAN tag(s) that the UPF has learned from the UE side to the SMF. In the case of any changes in the Ethernet context, the change is updated to the SMF so that the SMF maintains an up-to-date state of the Ethernet context. This signalling is realized based on N4 reporting. 2. The UPF's report is acknowledged. 3-5. In the case of handover, the RAN handover preparation and execution is followed by path switch signalling to the AMF and corresponding signalling to SMF, as defined in clause 4.9.1.2. 6. The SMF decides that the PSA is to be changed for the Ethernet PDU Session and selects the Target UPF that will act as the new PSA. The decision may be triggered by a mobility event, such as receiving the message in step 5. 7. The Target UPF N4 session is established. The SMF provides the N3 tunnel endpoint used by RAN. 8. The establishment of the new N4 session is acknowledged from the Target UPF to the SMF. The UPF provides its N3 tunnel endpoint. 9-10. In the case of handover, the SMF signals to the RAN via the AMF to provide the Path Switch Request Ack, which includes the update of the uplink N3 tunnel endpoint to the target UPF. This signalling is defined in clause 4.9.1.2. In steps 9-10, an indication is sent from the SMF via the AMF to the RAN node indicating that the RAN node should not expect to receive an end marker packet. The RAN node may skip trying to reorder the downlink packets. 11-12. If there is no handover and the UE is in connected mode, the SMF sends PDU Session Modify Request message to the RAN via the AMF, which includes the update of the uplink N3 tunnel endpoint to the target UPF. The RAN acknowledges the message. The RAN node does not need to to reorder the downlink packets. NOTE 1: Due to the change in the end to end path, packet re-ordering can occur both for the handover and no handover cases. If necessary, upper layer protocols can ensure in sequence delivery. After steps 9-10 or 11-12, uplink Ethernet frames pass via the target UPF. Downlink Ethernet frames may continue to be delivered from the source UPF to the RAN node. In the case of handover, the Ethernet frames are forwarded from the source RAN node to the target RAN node. 13-14. The SMF sends an N4 Session Modification Request to the Target UPF which includes the information in Ethernet context (i.e. MAC address and VLAN tag(s)) and a trigger for updating the Ethernet forwarding (next step). The Target UPF acknowledges by an N4 Session Modification Response. 15. The Target UPF may assist in the update of Ethernet forwarding tables of Ethernet switches in the DN via a variety of mechanisms, the use of which are specific to the DN and the specification of which are out-of-scope for 3GPP. NOTE 2: The UPF acting as a switch in the DN, can for example issue a Gratuitous ARP (GARP) containing the MAC address(es) of the UE that has switched to the new anchor, or the UPF can send an unsolicited Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) Neighbor Advertisement message indicating the UE MAC addresses, or the UPF can generate a uplink Ethernet frame with the UE's MAC addresses as source MAC addresses (and possibly its VLAN tag(s)) and configurable payload which will be dropped by endhosts, or the UPF can send another message or Ethernet frame compatible with DN protocols. In the case of a central controller in the Ethernet network which sets the forwarding tables, the central controller can be instructed that the given MAC address is reachable at the new location. When multiple MAC addresses are present in the Ethernet context, the update of the Ethernet forwarding is performed for each MAC address. 16. The N4 session is released at the Source UPF. The source UPF may wait for a configurable period before it stops delivering downlink Ethernet frames for the given PDU Session. 17. The N4 session release is acknowledged from the Source UPF to the SMF.","PDU Session Anchor (PSA) is a 5G Network Function that allows for Ethernet PDU Sessions to change the PDU Session Anchor while the session remains set up. It involves the Source UPF acting as the PSA, reporting Ethernet context information to the SMF, which determines whether and when a serving PDU Session anchor needs to be changed and selects the Target PSA UPF.","PDU Session Anchor is classified under Telecommunications Concept because it relates to the management of network sessions and the exchange of information between different nodes in the network, specifically in the context of 5G networks and Ethernet PDU Sessions.",3GPP TS 23.502,4.3.5.8 Ethernet PDU Session Anchor Relocation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A dynamic IPv6 address is given using stateless address autoconfiguration. This IPv6 address is used for packet forwarding within the packet domain and for packet forwarding on the Intranet/ISP. When a P-GW receives an initial access request (e.g. Create Session Request or Proxy Binding Update) message, the P-GW deduces from local configuration data associated with the APN: - The source of IPv6 Prefixes (P-GW internal prefix pool, or external address allocation server); - Any server(s) to be used for address allocation, authentication and/or protocol configuration options retrieval (e.g. IMS related configuration, see 3GPP TS 24.229[ IP multimedia call control protocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Protocol (SDP); Stage 3 ]  [47]); - The protocol, i.e. RADIUS, Diameter or DHCPv6, to be used with the server(s); - The communication and security feature needed to communicate with the server(s); As an example the P-GW may use one of the following options: - P-GW internal Prefix pool for IPv6 prefixes allocation and no authentication; - P-GW internal Prefix pool for IPv6 prefixes allocation and RADIUS for authentication. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the P-GW; - RADIUS for authentication and IPv6 prefix allocation. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the P-GW; The P-GW includes the PDP Address IE in the the initial access response (e.g. Create Session Response or Proxy Binding Acknowledgement) and return an IPv6 address composed of a Prefix and an Interface-Identifier. The Interface-Identifier may have any value and it does not need to be unique within or across APNs. It shall however not conflict with the Interface-Identifier that the P-GW has selected for its own side of the UE-P-GW link. The Prefix assigned by the P-GW or the external AAA server shall be globally or site-local unique (see the Note in subclause 11.3 of this document regarding the usage of site-local addresses).

If the GGSN/P-GW has no P-CSCF address available, the GGSN/P-GW shall ignore the request. If the GGSN/P-GW provides more than one P-CSCF IPv4/IPv6 address in the response, the GGSN/P-GW shall sort the addresses with the highest priority P-CSCF server first in the PCO IE. The GGSN/P-GW may use different prioritisations for different Mses/UEs, e.g. for load sharing between the P-CSCF servers.

OAM,Operation and Maintenance,Network Function,V,"The feature is activated in the gNB either by direct configuration from the OAM system (management-based activation), or by signalling from the OAM via the 5GC (signalling-based activation), containing UE-associated QoE configuration. One or more QoE measurement collection jobs can be activated at a UE per service type, and each QoE measurement configuration is uniquely identified by a QoE reference. For signalling-based QoE measurements, the OAM initiates the QoE measurement activation for a specific UE via the 5GC, and the gNB receives one or more QoE measurement configurations by means of UE-associated signalling. The QoE measurement configuration for signalling-based activation includes an application layer measurement configuration list and the corresponding information for QoE measurement collection, e.g., QoE reference, service type, MCE IP address, slice scope, area scope, MDT alignment information, the indication of available RAN visible QoE metrics and assistance information. For management-based QoE measurement activation, the OAM sends one or more QoE measurement configurations directly to the gNB. The QoE measurement configuration for management-based activation also includes an application layer measurement configuration list and the corresponding information for QoE measurement collection. The gNB selects UE(s) that meet the required QoE measurement capability, area scope and slice scope. Application layer measurement configuration received by the gNB from OAM or 5GC is encapsulated in a transparent container, which is forwarded to a UE as Application layer configuration in the RRCReconfiguration message (there can be multiple configurations in the same message). Application layer measurement reports received from UE's application layer are encapsulated in a transparent container and sent to the network in the MeasurementReportAppLayer message, as specified in TS 38.331[ NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification ]  [12]. The UE can send multiple application layer measurement reports to the gNB in one MeasurementReportAppLayer message. In order to allow the transmission of application layer measurement reports which exceed the maximum PDCP SDU size, segmentation of the MeasurementReportAppLayer message may be enabled by the gNB. A measurement configuration application layer ID conveyed in the RRC signalling is used to identify the application layer measurement configuration and report between the gNB and the UE. The measurement configuration application layer ID is mapped to the QoE reference in the gNB, and the gNB forwards the application layer measurement report to MCE together with the QoE reference. The gNB can release one or multiple application layer measurement configurations from the UE in one RRCReconfiguration message at any time. The UE may additionally be configured by the gNB to report when a QoE measurement session starts or stops for a certain application layer measurement configuration.","Operation and Maintenance (OAM) is a critical network function in the context of 5G networks, responsible for managing and configuring various aspects of the network.

PCC,Policy and Charging Control,Network Function,V,"The Evolved Packet System applies the PCC framework as defined in TS 23.203[ Policy and charging control architecture ]  [6] for QoS policy and charging control. PCC functionality is present in the AF, PCEF and PCRF. An EPS needs to both PCEF and PCRF functionality to enable dynamic policy and charging control by means of installation of PCC rules based on user and service dimensions. However, an EPS may only PCEF functionality in which case it shall static policy and charging control. NOTE: The local configuration of PCEF static policy and charging control functionality is not subject to standardization. The PCEF static policy and control functionality is not based on subscription information. The following applies to the use of dynamic policy and charging control in EPS: - The service level (per SDF) QoS parameters are conveyed in PCC rules (one PCC rule per SDF) over the Gx reference point. The service level QoS parameters consist of a QoS Class Identifier (QCI) Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) and authorised Guaranteed and Maximum Bit Rate values for uplink and downlink. The QCI is a scalar that represents the QoS characteristics that the EPS is expected to provide for the SDF. ARP is an indicator of the priority for the SDF that is used to decide about the assignment of resources due to resource limitations. The service level ARP assigned by PCRF in a PCC rule may be different from the bearer level ARP stored in subscription data; - The set of standardized QCIs and their characteristics that the PCRF in an EPS can select from is provided in TS 23.203[ Policy and charging control architecture ]  [6]. It is expected that the PCRF selects a QCI in such a way that the IP-CAN receiving it can support it; - It is not required that an IP-CAN supports all standardized QCIs; - In the case of IP address configuration subsequent to initial attachment, i.e. through DHCP mechanism to complete the IP address configuration, the PDN GW/PCEF shall notify the PCRF of the UE's IP address by means of an IP-CAN Session Modification procedure or IP-CAN Session Establishment procedure as defined in TS 23.203[ Policy and charging control architecture ]  [6] when it is assigned. If the PCRF response leads to an EPS bearer modification the PDN GW should initiate a bearer update procedure; - For local breakout, the visited network has the capability to reject the QoS authorized by the home network based on operator policies. The following applies regardless of whether dynamic or static policy and charging control is used in EPS: - For E-UTRAN the value of the ARP of an EPS bearer is identical to the value of the ARP of the SDF(s) mapped to that EPS bearer; - For the same UE/PDN connection: SDFs associated with different QCIs or with the same service-level QCI but different ARP shall not be mapped to the same EPS bearer; - The bearer level QCI of an EPS bearer is identical to the value of the QCI of the SDF(s) mapped to that EPS bearer.","The Policy and Charging Control (PCC) framework, as defined in TS 23.203, is a crucial component within the Evolved Packet System (EPS).

RAN,Radio Access Network,Network Function,V,"An eNodeB may connect to several MMEs. This implies that an eNodeB must be able to determine which of the MMEs, covering the area where an UE is located, should receive the signalling sent from a UE. To avoid unnecessary signalling in the core network, a UE that has attached to one MME should generally continue to be served by this MME as long as the UE is in the radio coverage of the pool area to which the MME is associated. The concept of pool area is a RAN based definition that comprises one or more TA(s) that, from a RAN perspective, are served by a certain group of MMEs. This does not exclude that one or more of the MMEs in this group serve TAs outside the pool area. This group of MMEs is also referred to as an MME pool. To enable the eNodeB to determine which MME to select when forwarding messages from an UE, this functionality defines a routing mechanism (and other related mechanism). A routing mechanism (and other related mechanism) is defined for the MMEs. The routing mechanism is required to find the correct old MME (from the multiple MMEs that are associated with a pool area). When a UE roams out of the pool area and into the area of one or more MMEs that do not know about the internal structure of the pool area where the UE roamed from, the new MME will send the Identification Request message or the Context Request message to the old MME using the GUTI. The routing mechanism in both the MMEs and the eNodeB utilises the fact that every MME that serves a pool area must have its own unique value range of the GUTI parameter within the pool area.","The Radio Access Network (RAN) is a critical component in the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) architecture, responsible for managing radio resources and providing access to the core network.

For the procedure described below, it is a prerequisite that the UE is already registered to the 5GC and both SMF and UPF support the L2TP feature. NOTE 1: The scenario where the UE sends actual PPP frames/signalling towards the LAC, which involves back and forth message exchanges between the UE and LAC, for example for LCP Negotiation, is not in the scope of the present document. NOTE 2: The UE does not need to be aware of the L2TP procedure. Figure 4.3.2.4-1: Support of L2TP 1. This step is the same as step 1 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 or step 1 in clause 4.3.2.2.2. The PDU session establishment may include in the PCO information authentication information for PAP and/or CHAP. 2. The SMF may determine that an L2TP session is required for the PDU Session based on local configuration (e.g. related with DNN/S-NSSAI). The SMF may retrieve the L2TP Tunnel parameters from the DN-AAA Server, as described in clause 4.3.2.3, or be configured locally with L2TP Tunnel parameters. The L2TP Tunnel parameters may include information such as the LNS addressing information (e.g. IP address or hostname), as defined in TS 29.561[ 5G System; Interworking between 5G Network and external Data Networks; Stage 3 ]  [63]. 3. This step is the same as step 8 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following additions: If L2TP is required for the PDU Session, the SMF selects a UPF supporting L2TP. 4. This step is the same as step 10a in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following additions: The SMF requests the UPF to setup an L2TP Session towards the L2TP server (LNS). The SMF may send to the UPF as part of N4 signalling, L2TP Tunnel Information and L2TP Session Information to setup a L2TP session. The L2TP Session Information includes specific information related to the PDU Session, e.g. a Calling Number which may be set to UE's SUPI, the Called Number for the L2TP Session which may be configured to contain the DNN, PAP/CHAP related parameters if included by the UE in PCO in step 1 etc. This information is defined in TS 29.561[ 5G System; Interworking between 5G Network and external Data Networks; Stage 3 ]  [63]. 5.

GW,Gateway,Network Function,V,"The PDN GW may provide mechanisms for avoiding and handling overload situations. These include the rejection of PDN connection requests from UEs. The PDN GW may detect APN congestion and start and stop performing overload control based on criteria such as: - Maximum number of active bearers per APN; and/or - Maximum rate of bearer activations per APN. When performing overload control the PDN GW rejects PDN connection requests. When receiving the rejection from the PDN GW, the MME rejects the UE's PDN connection request as specified in clause 4.3.7.4.2. In addition the PDN GW may indicate a ""PDN GW back-off time"" for a specific APN to the MME. The MME should reject PDN connection requests, for the specific APN related to that PDN GW during the ""PDN GW back-off time"", by the means specified in clause 4.3.7.4.2. If a PDN GW indicates APN congestion by the ""PDN GW back-off time"" the MME may select another PDN GW of that APN instead of rejecting PDN connection requests unless there is already an existing PDN connection to the same APN for the UE, in which case, the MME shall reject PDN connection request.","The Gateway (GW), specifically referred to as the Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN GW) in this context, is a network function that plays a crucial role in managing packet data networks. It is responsible for controlling and handling overload situations by rejecting PDN connection requests from User Equipment (UEs) when certain criteria such as maximum number of active bearers per Access Point Name (APN) or maximum rate of bearer activations per APN are met.

DN-AAA,"Data Network - Authentication, Authorization and Accounting",Network Function,V,"EAP-based secondary authentication and authorization at PDU Session establishment is supported as defined in clause 4.3.2.3. EAP-based secondary authentication and authorization at PDN connection establishment is supported as defined in Annex H. This clause 4.11.0a.7 defines the support of secondary authorization over EPS without EAP-based authentication when one of the UE, the 5GC and the DN does not support (or is configured not to use) the mechanisms defined in Annex H. NOTE 1: This implies that when data connectivity to the DN is initiated as a PDU Session over 5GC it can be subject to EAP based secondary authentication mechanism (see TS 33.501[ Security architecture and procedures for 5G System ]  [15]) whereas, when data connectivity to the same DN is initiated as a PDN connection over EPC it cannot be subject to EAP based secondary authentication mechanism. This discrepancy occurs regardless of whether the data connection is later on moved between EPC and 5GC. NOTE 2: Secondary authorization without authentication means no signalling exchange with the UE. If secondary authentication and authorization has been performed for the PDU Session while the UE was in 5GS and the UE has moved to EPS, the following applies: - DN-AAA re-authorization (without re-authentication signalling) can be performed even when the UE is in EPS, e.g. to provide new parameters from the DN-AAA Server to SMF+PGW-C. - Re-authentication cannot be performed while the UE is in EPS because there is no support of the related signalling in EPS. In case the SMF+PGW-C receives a re-authentication request from the DN-AAA, the SMF+PGW-C informs the DN-AAA Server that the UE is not available for re-authentication at the moment. The SMF+PGW-C should not initiate PDN connection release at this point: the DN-AAA decides the actions to take, based on the reply from SMF+PGW-C and local policy which may also trigger a DN-AAA Server request to release the PDU Session/PDN connection of the UE.","The Data Network - Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (DN-AAA) is a network function that plays a crucial role in managing user authentication, authorization, and accounting within the data network.

GERAN,GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network,Network Function,V,"If the MME, e.g. based on SRVCC capability in NAS, UE Usage Type or local policy, requires more information on the UE radio capabilities support to be able to set the IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication (see clause 4.3.5.8), then the MME may send a UE Radio Capability Match Request message to the eNodeB. This procedure is typically used during the Initial Attach procedure, during Tracking Area Update procedure for the ""first TAU following GERAN/UTRAN Attach"" or for ""UE radio capability update"" or when MME has not received the Voice Support Match Indicator (as part of the MM Context). Figure 5.3.14-1: UE Radio Capability Match Request 1 The MME indicates whether the MME wants to receive Voice support match indicator. The MME may include the UE Radio Capability information that it has previously received from the eNodeB via a S1-AP UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION as described in clause 5.11.2. 2. Upon receiving a UE Radio Capability Match Request from the MME, if the eNodeB has not already received the UE radio capabilities from the UE or from MME in step 1, the eNodeB requests the UE to upload the UE radio capability information by sending the RRC UE Capability Enquiry. 3. The UE provides the eNodeB with its UE radio capabilities sending the RRC UE Capability Information. 4. The eNodeB checks whether the UE radio capabilities are compatible with the network configuration for ensuring voice service continuity of voice calls initiated in IMS. For determining the appropriate UE Radio Capability Match Response, the eNodeB is configured by the operator to check whether the UE supports certain capabilities required for Voice continuity of voice calls using IMS PS. In a shared network, the eNodeB keeps a configuration separately per PLMN. NOTE 1: What checks to perform depends on network configuration, i.e. following are some examples of UE capabilities to be taken into account: - the SRVCC, and UTRAN/E-UTRAN Voice over PS capabilities; - the Radio capabilities for UTRAN/E-UTRAN FDD and/or TDD; and/or - the support of UTRAN/E-UTRAN frequency bands. NOTE 2: The network configuration considered in the decision for the Voice Support Match Indicator is homogenous within a certain area (e.g. MME Pool Area) in order to guarantee that the Voice Support Match Indicator from the eNodeB is valid within such area. The eNodeB provides a Voice Support Match Indicator to the MME to indicate whether the UE capabilities and networks configuration are compatible for ensuring voice service continuity of voice calls initiated in IMS. The MME stores the received Voice support match indicator in the MM Context and uses it as an input for setting the IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication. 5.

An AMF may subscribe with the UCMF to obtain from the UCMF new values of UE Radio Capability ID that the UCMF assigns for the purpose of caching them locally. Provisioning of Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID entries in the UCMF is performed from an AF that interacts with the UCMF either directly or via the NEF (or via Network Management) using a procedure defined in TS 23.502[ Procedures for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3].

The UCMF also assigns the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID values. Each PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is also associated to the TAC of the UE model(s) that it is related to. When an AMF requests the UCMF to assign a UE Radio Capability ID for a set of UE radio capabilities, it indicates the TAC of the UE that the UE Radio Capability information is related to. The UCMF stores a Version ID value for the PLMN assigned UE Radio Capability IDs so it is included in the PLMN assigned UE Radio Capability IDs it assigns. This shall be configured in the UCMF.

TSN,Time-Sensitive Networking,Network Function,V,"5GS acts as a Layer 2 Ethernet Bridge. When integrated with IEEE TSN network, 5GS functions acts as one or more TSN Bridges of the TSN network. The 5GS Bridge is composed of the ports on a single UPF (i.e. PSA) side, the user plane tunnel between the UE and UPF, and the ports on the DS-TT side. For each 5GS Bridge of a TSN network, the port on NW-TT support the connectivity to the TSN network, the ports on DS-TT side are associated to the PDU Session providing connectivity to the TSN network. The granularity of the 5GS TSN bridge is per UPF for each network instance or DNN/S-NSSAI. The bridge ID of the 5GS TSN bridge is bound to the UPF ID of the UPF as identified in TS 23.502[ Procedures for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3]. The TSN AF stores the binding relationship between a port on UE/DS-TT side and a PDU Session during reporting of 5GS TSN bridge information. The TSN AF also stores the information about ports on the UPF/NW-TT side. The UPF/NW-TT forwards traffic to the appropriate egress port based on the traffic forwarding information. From the TSN AF point of view, a 5GS TSN bridge has a single NW-TT entity within UPF and the NW-TT may have multiple ports that are used for traffic forwarding. NOTE 1: How to realize single NW-TT entity within UPF is up to implementation. NOTE 2: Ethernet PDU Session type in this release of the specification may be subject to the constraint that it supports a single N6 interface in a UPF associated with the N6 Network Instance. There is only one PDU Session per DS-TT port for a given UPF. All PDU Sessions which connect to the same TSN network via a specific UPF are grouped into a single 5GS bridge. The capabilities of each port on UE/DS-TT side and UPF/NW-TT side are integrated as part of the configuration of the 5GS Bridge and are notified to TSN AF and delivered to CNC for TSN bridge registration and modification. NOTE 3: It is assumed that all PDU Sessions which connect to the same TSN network via a specific UPF are handled by the same TSN AF. Figure 5.28.1-1: Per UPF based 5GS bridge NOTE 4: If a UE establishes multiple PDU Sessions terminating in different UPFs, then the UE is represented by multiple 5GS TSN bridges. In order to support IEEE 802.1Q features related to TSN, including TSN scheduled traffic (clause 8.6.8.4 in IEEE Std 802.1Q [98]) over 5GS Bridge, the 5GS supports the following functions: - Configure the bridge information in 5GS. - Report the bridge information of 5GS Bridge to TSN network after PDU Session establishment. - Receiving the configuration from TSN network as defined in clause 5.28.2. - Map the configuration information obtained from TSN network into 5GS QoS information (e.g. 5QI, TSC Assistance Information) of a QoS Flow in corresponding PDU Session for efficient time-aware scheduling, as defined at clause 5.28.2. The bridge information of 5GS Bridge is used by the TSN network to make appropriate management configuration for the 5GS Bridge. The bridge information of 5GS Bridge includes at least the following: - Information for 5GS Bridge: - Bridge ID Bridge ID is to distinguish between bridge instances within 5GS. The Bridge ID can be derived from the unique bridge MAC address as described in IEEE Std 802.1Q [98], or set by implementation specific means ensuring that unique values are used within 5GS; - Number of Ports; - list of port numbers. - Capabilities of 5GS Bridge as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q [98]: - 5GS Bridge delay per port pair per traffic class, including 5GS Bridge delay (dependent and independent of frame size, and their maximum and minimum values: independentDelayMax, independentDelayMin, dependentDelayMax, dependentDelayMin), ingress port number, egress port number and traffic class. - Propagation delay per port (txPropagationDelay), including transmission propagation delay, egress port number. - VLAN Configuration Information. NOTE 5: This Release of the specification does not support the modification of VLAN Configuration Information at the TSN AF. - Topology of 5GS Bridge as defined in IEEE Std 802.1AB [97]: - LLDP Configuration Information. - Chassis ID subtype and Chassis ID of the 5GS Bridge. - LLDP Discovery Information for each discovered neighbor of each NW-TT port and DS-TT port. - Traffic classes and their priorities per port as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q [98]. - Stream Parameters as defined in clause 12.31.1 in IEEE Std 802.1Q [98], in order to support PSFP: - MaxStreamFilterInstances: The maximum number of Stream Filter instances supported by the bridge; - MaxStreamGateInstances: The maximum number of Stream Gate instances supported by the bridge; - MaxFlowMeterInstances: The maximum number of Flow Meter instances supported by the bridge (optional); - SupportedListMax: The maximum value supported by the bridge of the AdminControlListLength and OperControlListLength parameters. The following parameters: independentDelayMax and independentDelayMin, how to calculate them is left to implementation and not defined in this specification. DS-TT and NW-TT report txPropagationDelay to the TSN AF relative to the time base of the TSN GM clock (identified by the TSN time domain number received in PMIC). If the TSN AF has subscribed for notifications on txPropagationDelay and if the difference to the previously reported txPropagationDelay is larger than the txPropagationDelayDeltaThreshold received in PMIC, the corresponding DS-TT or NW-TT informs the TSN AF about the updated txPropagationDelay using PMIC signalling. NOTE 6: Configuration of TSN time domain number and txPropagationDelayDeltaThreshold via PMIC is optional for NW-TT. NW-TT can instead be pre-configured with the threshold and the single time domain that is used by the CNC for bridge configuration and reporting. Bridge ID of the 5GS Bridge, port number(s) of the Ethernet port(s) in NW-TT could be preconfigured on the UPF. The UPF is selected for a PDU Session serving TSC as described in clause 6.3.3.3. This release of the specification requires that each DS-TT port is assigned with a globally unique MAC address. NOTE 7: The MAC address of the DS-TT port must not be used in user data traffic; it is used for identification of the PDU Session and the associated bridge port within the 3GPP system. When there are multiple network instances within a UPF, each network instance is considered logically separate. The network instance for the N6 interface (clause 5.6.12) may be indicated by the SMF to the UPF for a given PDU Session during PDU Session establishment. UPF allocates resources based on the Network Instance and S-NSSAI and it is supported according to TS 29.244[ Interface between the Control Plane and the User Plane nodes ]  [65]. DNN/S-NSSAI may be indicated by the SMF together with the network instance to the UPF for a given PDU Session during PDU Session establishment procedure. The TSN AF is responsible to receive the bridge information of 5GS Bridge from 5GS, as well as register or update this information to the CNC.","Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of standards defined by the IEEE to ensure deterministic communication over Ethernet networks.

The NEF responds with the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdate. 6-7. The TSCTSF uses the PTP instance reference included in the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdate request to identify the time synchronization service configuration and the corresponding AF sessions. If the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdate request includes updated service parameters for the PTP instance and if the corresponding DS-TT(s) and NW-TT are suitable with the parameters (e.g. requested PTP instance type, transport protocol and PTP profile), the TSCTSF uses the procedures described in clause K.2.2 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2] to update the PTP instance(s) in the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT. If the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdate request includes one or more UE identities to be added to the PTP instance, if the corresponding DS-TT(s) are suitable with the parameters (e.g. requested PTP instance type, transport protocol and PTP profile) in the time synchronization service configuration as identified by the PTP instance reference in the request: - the TSCTSF adds the suitable AF-sessions to the list of AF-sessions that are associated with the time synchronization service configuration; and - the TSCTSF uses the procedures described in clause K.2.2 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2] to initialize and activate the PTP instance(s) in the corresponding DS-TT(s). - the TSCTSF uses the procedure in clause 4.15.9.4 to modify or activate the 5G access stratum time distribution for the UEs that are added to the impacted PTP instance. If the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdate request includes one or more UE identities to be removed to the PTP instance, the TSCTSF removes the corresponding AF-sessions from the list of AF-sessions associated with the time synchronization configuration. The TSCTSF uses the procedure in clause 4.15.9.4 to remove the 5G access stratum time distribution parameters for the UEs that are removed from the impacted PTP instance. 8.

TRP,Transmit/Receive Point,Network Function,V,"In Multiple Transmit/Receive Point (multi-TRP) operation, a serving cell can schedule the UE from two TRPs, providing better coverage, reliability and/or data rates for PDSCH, PDCCH, PUSCH, and PUCCH. There are two different operation modes to schedule multi-TRP PDSCH transmissions: single-DCI and multi-DCI. For both modes, control of uplink and downlink operation can be done by physical layer and MAC layer, within the configuration provided by the RRC layer. In single-DCI mode, the UE is scheduled by the same DCI for both TRPs and in multi-DCI mode, the UE is scheduled by independent DCIs from each TRP. There are two different operation modes for multi-TRP PDCCH: PDCCH repetition as in Clause 5.2.3 and Single Frequency Network (SFN) based PDCCH transmission. In both modes, the UE can receive two PDCCH transmissions, one from each TRP, carrying the same DCI. In PDCCH repetition mode, the UE can receive the two PDCCH transmissions carrying the same DCI from two linked search spaces each associated with a different CORESET. In SFN based PDCCH transmission mode, the UE can receive the two PDCCH transmissions carrying the same DCI from a single search space/CORESET using different TCI states. For multi-TRP PUSCH repetition, according to indications in a single DCI or in a semi-static configured grant provided over RRC, the UE performs PUSCH transmission of the same contents toward two TRPs with corresponding beam directions associated with different spatial relations. For multi-TRP PUCCH repetition, the UE performs PUCCH transmission of the same contents toward two TRPs with corresponding beam directions associated with different spatial relations. For inter-cell multi-TRP operation, for multi-DCI PDSCH transmission, one or more TCI states can be associated with SSB with a PCI different from the serving cell PCI. The activated TCI states can be associated with at most one PCI different from the serving cell PCI at a time. For inter-cell and intra-cell multi-DCI multi-TRP operation, up to two TAGs with associated TAG IDs can be configured per serving cell. Each UL/Joint TCI state is associated with a TAG ID and the UE applies the timing advance of the TAG ID associated with the UL/joint TCI state utilized for UL transmission. For single-DCI multi-TRP Simultaneous Transmission with Multi-Panel (STxMP) Spatial Domain Multiplexing (SDM) PUSCH transmission, different layers of one PUSCH are separately transmitted towards two TRPs. For single-DCI multi-TRP STxMP SFN PUSCH transmission, same layers of one PUSCH are transmitted towards two TRPs. For multi-DCI based multi-TRP STxMP PUSCH+PUSCH transmission, two PUSCHs are transmitted towards two TRPs.

If the verification of UPU-MAC-IAUSF is successful and the UPU Data contains any parameters that is protected by secured packet (see 3GPP TS 31.115[ Secured packet structure for (Universal) Subscriber Identity Module (U)SIM Toolkit applications ]  [65]), the ME shall forward the secured packet to the USIM using procedures in 3GPP TS 31.111[ Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) Application Toolkit (USAT) ]  [66]. If the verification of UPU-MAC-IAUSF is successful and the UPU Data contains any parameters that is not protected by secure packet, the ME shall update its stored parameters with the received parameters in UDM Updata Data. 7) If the UDM has requested an acknowledgement from the UE and the UE has successfully verified and updated the UE Parameters Update Data provided by the UDM, then the UE shall send the UL NAS Transport message to the serving AMF. The UE shall generate the UPU-MAC-IUE as specified in Annex A.20 and include the generated UPU-MAC-IUE in a transparent container in the UL NAS Transport message. 8) If a transparent container with the UPU-MAC-IUE was received in the UL NAS Transport message, the AMF shall send a Nudm_SDM_Info request message with the transparent container to the UDM. 9) If the UDM indicated that the UE is to acknowledge the successful security check of the received UE Parameters Update Data, then the UDM shall compare the received UPU-MAC-IUE with the expected UPU-XMAC-IUE that the UDM stored temporarily in step 4.

eNodeB,Evolved Node B,Network Function,V,"An eNodeB may connect to several MMEs. This implies that an eNodeB must be able to determine which of the MMEs, covering the area where an UE is located, should receive the signalling sent from a UE. To avoid unnecessary signalling in the core network, a UE that has attached to one MME should generally continue to be served by this MME as long as the UE is in the radio coverage of the pool area to which the MME is associated. The concept of pool area is a RAN based definition that comprises one or more TA(s) that, from a RAN perspective, are served by a certain group of MMEs. This does not exclude that one or more of the MMEs in this group serve TAs outside the pool area. This group of MMEs is also referred to as an MME pool. To enable the eNodeB to determine which MME to select when forwarding messages from an UE, this functionality defines a routing mechanism (and other related mechanism). A routing mechanism (and other related mechanism) is defined for the MMEs. The routing mechanism is required to find the correct old MME (from the multiple MMEs that are associated with a pool area). When a UE roams out of the pool area and into the area of one or more MMEs that do not know about the internal structure of the pool area where the UE roamed from, the new MME will send the Identification Request message or the Context Request message to the old MME using the GUTI. The routing mechanism in both the MMEs and the eNodeB utilises the fact that every MME that serves a pool area must have its own unique value range of the GUTI parameter within the pool area.","The Evolved Node B (eNodeB) is a critical network element in the LTE architecture, responsible for managing radio resources and communicating with User Equipment (UE).

EAP-based secondary authentication and authorization at PDN connection establishment is supported as defined in Annex H. This clause 4.11.0a.7 defines the support of secondary authorization over EPS without EAP-based authentication when one of the UE, the 5GC and the DN does not support (or is configured not to use) the mechanisms defined in Annex H. NOTE 1: This implies that when data connectivity to the DN is initiated as a PDU Session over 5GC it can be subject to EAP based secondary authentication mechanism (see TS 33.501[ Security architecture and procedures for 5G System ]  [15]) whereas, when data connectivity to the same DN is initiated as a PDN connection over EPC it cannot be subject to EAP based secondary authentication mechanism. This discrepancy occurs regardless of whether the data connection is later on moved between EPC and 5GC. NOTE 2: Secondary authorization without authentication means no signalling exchange with the UE. If secondary authentication and authorization has been performed for the PDU Session while the UE was in 5GS and the UE has moved to EPS, the following applies: - DN-AAA re-authorization (without re-authentication signalling) can be performed even when the UE is in EPS, e.g. to provide new parameters from the DN-AAA Server to SMF+PGW-C. - Re-authentication cannot be performed while the UE is in EPS because there is no support of the related signalling in EPS.

NOTE: In Requested NSSAI across all Access Type(s), the UE needs to include S-NSSAIs that share at least one common NSSRG. An AMF which supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slice feature configures a non-supporting UE with a Configured NSSAI including only the S-NSSAIs sharing all the NSSRG values of the default S-NSSAI(s), except if it has been instructed otherwise by the UDM. In addition to the default S-NSSAI(s), the AMF sends to the UE in the Configured NSSAI any other subscribed S-NSSAI whose NSSRG match at least those defined for the default S-NSSAI(s). The UDM in a supporting HPLMN may optionally keep a record of the PEIs or Type Allocation Codes values regarding UE ability to handle network slices that cannot be provided simultaneously in Allowed NSSAI. The UDM may, based on configuration or the optional PEI records, indicate the AMF to provide the non-supporting UEs with the full set of subscribed S-NSSAIs even if they do not share a common NSSRG.

When a PCC rule including the Application Function influence on traffic routing Enforcement Control information defined in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.503[ Policy and charging control framework for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 ]  [45] is provided to the SMF, the SMF can decide whether to apply traffic routing (by using UL Classifier functionality or IPv6 multi-homing) based on DNAI(s) included in the PCC rule. NOTE 1: Application Function influence on traffic routing Enforcement Control information can be either determined by the PCF when requested by AF via NEF as described in clause 5.6.7.1 or statically pre-configured in the PCF. NOTE 2: Selective traffic routing to the DN supports, for example, deployments where some selected traffic is forwarded on an N6 interface to the DN that is ""close"" to the AN serving the UE. This may correspond to - The Usage of UL Classifier functionality for a PDU Session defined in clause 5.6.4.2. - The Usage of an IPv6 multi-homing for a PDU Session defined in clause 5.6.4.3. SMF may also take decision to apply traffic routing (by using UL Classifier functionality or IPv6 multi-homing) in EAS Discovery with EASDF procedure described in TS 23.548[ 5G System Enhancements for Edge Computing; Stage 2 ]  [130].","The Access Network (AN) is a network function that serves the User Equipment (UE), providing access to various services and networks.

ANR,Automatic Neighbour Relation,Network Function,V,"The purpose of ANR function is to relieve the operator from the burden of manually managing NCRs. Figure 15.3.3.1-1 shows ANR and its environment: Figure 15.3.3.1-1: Interaction between gNB and OAM due to ANR The ANR function resides in the gNB and manages the Neighbour Cell Relation Table (NCRT). Located within ANR, the Neighbour Detection Function finds new neighbours and adds them to the NCRT. ANR also contains the Neighbour Removal Function which removes outdated NCRs. The Neighbour Detection Function and the Neighbour Removal Function are implementation specific. An existing NCR from a source cell to a target cell means that gNB controlling the source cell: a) Knows the global and physical IDs (e.g. NR CGI/NR PCI, ECGI/PCI) of the target cell; and b) Has an entry in the NCRT for the source cell identifying the target cell; and c) Has the attributes in this NCRT entry defined, either by OAM or set to default values. NCRs are cell-to-cell relations, while an Xn link is set up between two gNBs. Neighbour Cell Relations are unidirectional, while an Xn link is bidirectional. NOTE: The neighbour information exchange, which occurs during the Xn Setup procedure or in the gNB Configuration Update procedure, may be used for ANR purpose. The ANR function also allows OAM to manage the NCRT. OAM can add and delete NCRs. It can also change the attributes of the NCRT. The OAM system is informed about changes in the NCRT.","The Automatic Neighbour Relation (ANR) function is a procedure within the gNB that automates the management of Neighbour Cell Relations (NCRs), relieving operators from manual configuration burdens. It encompasses several sub-functions, including neighbour detection and removal, which dynamically update the Neighbour Cell Relation Table (NCRT). ANR enables the gNB to maintain accurate and up-to-date information about neighbouring cells, facilitating efficient network operations and handovers.","ANR is classified as a procedure because it involves a series of steps and functions that work together to manage neighbour cell relations.

Subsequently, the AF may only update the Member UE filtering criteria of the subscription as described in clause 4.15.13.0 by invoking Nnef_MemberUESelectionAssistance_subscribe and providing a Subscription Correlation ID, i.e. the AF does not provide the list of target member UEs again. NOTE: The time window(s) for selecting the candidate UE(s) is used by the NEF when subscribing/requesting to NWDAF. The NEF maps the time window(s) for selecting the candidate UE(s) to the Analytics target period, which should be included in the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request service operations. 2a. [CONDITIONAL] If the AF request does not contain a Subscription Correlation ID, the NEF verifies the authorization of the AF Request and identifies which information needs to be collected for each UE in the list of target member UEs and executes the corresponding service operations based on the Member UE filtering criteria provided by the AF, e.g. events, analytics ID(s), notifications, etc. 2b. [CONDITIONAL] If the AF request contains a Subscription Correlation ID, the NEF correlates the Nnef_MemberUESelectionAssistance_Subscribe request to an existing subscription according to the Subscription Correlation ID. The NEF uses the list of target member UE(s) received in step 1 for the Member UE update using the updated filtering criteria. 3. NEF interacts with different 5GC network functions to collect the required information for each UE in the list of target member UEs.

This message is sent to an AAA-P, if the AAA-P is used (e.g. the AAA Server belongs to a third party), otherwise it may be sent directly to the NSSAAF. If an AAA-P is present, the AAA-P relays the Reauthentication Request to the NSSAAF. 2. The NSSAAF checks whether the AAA-S is authorized to request the re-authentication and re-authorization by checking the local configuration of AAA-S address per S-NSSAI. If success,the NSSAAF requests UDM for the AMF serving the UE using the Nudm_UECM_Get (GPSI, AMF Registration) service operation.

SEPP,Security Edge Protection Proxy,Network Function,V,"The following clause illustrates the message flow between the two SEPPs with modifications from cIPX and pIPX. Figure 13.2.4.8-1 Message flow between two SEPPs 1. The cSEPP receives an HTTP request message from a network function. If the message contains a telescopic FQDN, the cSEPP removes its domain name from this FQDN to obtain the original FQDN as described in clause 13.1. 2. The cSEPP shall reformate the HTTP Request message as follows: a. The cSEPP shall generate blocks (JSON objects) for integrity protected data and encrypted data, and protecting them: The cSEPP shall encapsulate the HTTP request into a clearTextEncapsulatedMessage block containing the following child JSON objects: - Pseudo_Headers - HTTP_Headers with one element per header of the original request. - Payload that contains the message body of the original request. For each attribute that require end-to-end encryption between the two SEPPs, the attribute value is copied into a dataToIntegrityProtectAndCipher JSON object and the attribute's value in the clearTextEncapsulatedMessage is replaced by the index of attribute value in the dataToIntegrityProtectAndCipher block. The cSEPP shall create a metadata block that contains the N32-f context ID, message ID generated by the cSEPP for this request/response transaction and next hop identity. The cSEPP shall protect the dataToIntegrityProtect block and the dataToIntegrityProtectAndCipher block as per clause 13.2.4.4. This results in a single JWE object representing the protected HTTP Request message. b. The cSEPP shall generate payload for the SEPP to SEPP HTTP message: The JWE object becomes the payload of the new HTTP message generated by cSEPP. 3. The cSEPP shall use HTTP POST to send the HTTP message to the first Roaming Intermediary. 4. The first Roaming Intermediary (e.g. visited network's IPX provider) shall create a new modifiedDataToIntegrityProtect JSON object with three elements: a. The Operations JSON patch document contains modifications performed by the first Roaming Intermediary as per RFC 6902 [64]. b. The first Roaming Intermediary shall include its own identity in the Identity field of the modifiedDataToIntegrityProtect. c. The first Roaming Intermediary shall copy the ""tag"" element, present in the JWE object generated by the cSEPP, into the modifiedDataToIntegrityProtect object. This acts as a replay protection for updates made by the first Roaming Intermediary. The Roaming Intermediary shall execute JWS on the modifiedDataToIntegrityProtect JSON object and append the resulting JWS object to the message. 5. The first Roaming Intermediary shall send the modified HTTP message request to the second Roaming Intermediary (e.g. home network's IPX) as in step 3. 6. The second Roaming Intermediary shall perform further modifications as in step 4 if required. The second Roaming Intermediary shall further execute JWS on the modifiedDataToIntegrityProtect JSON object and shall append the resulting JWS object to the message. 7. The second Roaming Intermediary shall send the modified HTTP message to the pSEPP as in step 3. NOTE 1: The behaviour of the Roaming Intermediaries is not normative, but the pSEPP assumes that behaviour for processing the resulting request. 8. The pSEPP receives the message and shall perform the following actions: - The pSEPP extracts the serialized values from the components of the JWE object. - The pSEPP invokes the JWE AEAD algorithm to check the integrity of the message and decrypt the dataToIntegrityProtectAndCipher block. This results in entries in the encrypted block becoming visible in cleartext. - The pSEPP updates the clearTextEncapsulationMessage block in the message by replacing the references to the dataToIntegrityProtectAndCipher block with the referenced decrypted values from the dataToIntegrityProtectAndCipher block. - The pSEPP then verifies IPX provider updates of the attributes in the modificationsArray. It checks whether the modifications performed by the Roaming Intermediaries were permitted by policy. The pSEPP further verifies that the PLMN-ID contained in the message is equal to the ""Remote PLMN-ID"" in the related N32-f context. - The pSEPP updates the modified values of the attributes in the clearTextEncapsulationMessage in order. The pSEPP shall re-assemble the full HTTP Request from the contents of the clearTextEncapsulationMessage. 9.

a)	Lower layer failure
Upon detection of a lower layer failure before the IDENTITY RESPONSE is received, the network shall abort any ongoing EMM procedure.
b)	Expiry of timer T3470
The identification procedure is supervised by the network by the timer T3470. The network shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3470, retransmit the IDENTITY REQUEST message and reset and restart the timer T3470. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3470, the network shall abort the identification procedure and any ongoing EMM procedure.
c)	Collision of an identification procedure with an attach procedure
If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been completed and no attach procedure is pending on the network (i.e. no ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT message has still to be sent as an answer to an ATTACH REQUEST message), the network shall proceed with the attach procedure.
d)	Collision of an identification procedure with an attach procedure when the identification procedure has been caused by an attach procedure
If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been completed and an attach procedure is pending (i.e. an ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT message has to be sent as an answer to an earlier ATTACH REQUEST message), then:
-	If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST message differ from the ones received within the previous ATTACH REQUEST message, the network shall proceed with the new attach procedure; or
-	If the information elements do not differ, then the network shall not treat any further this new ATTACH REQUEST.

1.	The UE sends an IGMP (IPv4) or MLD (IPv6) Leave message over the default PDP context to leave a particular multicast service identified by an IP multicast address.
2.	The GGSN sends a STR to the BM-SC, indicating that the UE is requesting to leave the multicast service. The session to be terminated is uniquely identified by the Diameter session-id.
3.	Upon reception of the STR, the BM-SC verifies that the IP multicast address corresponds to a valid MBMS bearer service and sends a STA to the GGSN that originated the Leave Indication. The APN shall be the same that was provided during service activation (see "" Service Activation"" procedure).
4.	Upon reception of the STA the GGSN sends an MBMS UE Context Deactivation Request to the SGSN. The IP multicast address, APN and IMSI together identify the MBMS UE Context to be deleted by the SGSN. The APN is the one received in step 3.
5.	The GGSN receives a Delete MBMS Context Request (NSAPI). This GGSN may be different from the GGSN that receives IGMP Leave request in step 1.
6.	The GGSN deletes the MBMS UE Context and sends a STR to the BM-SC to confirm the successful deactivation of the MBMS UE Context.
7.  The BM-SC, then, deletes the MBMS UE Context and sends a confirmation to the GGSN in a STA message.
8.	If the GGSN does not have any more users interested in this MBMS bearer service and the ""list of downstream nodes"" in the corresponding MBSM Bearer Context is empty, the GGSN initiates a De-Registration procedure as specified in 17.5.5.

Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfPDUsUpdate_Request,NSAC Number Of PDUs Update Request,Message,V,"When EPS counting is required for a network slice and NSACF is configured with maximum number of UEs with at least one PDU Session/PDN Connection, the NSACF keeps track of the current number of UEs with at least one PDU session/PDN connection established on a network slice to ensure it does not exceed the maximum configured number. To support the NSAC for maximum number of UEs with at least one PDU Session/PDN Connection, the SMF+PGW-C may be configured with one of the following options: - Option 1: Triggering an Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfUEsUpdate_Request to NSACF for NSAC for maximum number of UEs when the UE establishes first PDU Session/PDN connection associated with the network slice in the SMF+PGW-C, or when the last PDU Session/PDN connection associated with the network slice is released. The NSACF performs admission control as described in clause 5.15.11.5 and the number of registered UE is replaced with number of UE with at least one PDU session/PDN connection. Also, if the maximum number of UEs with at least one PDU Session/PDN connection has already been reached and SMF+PGW-C receives the rejection from NSACF, unless operator policy implements a different action, the SMF+PGW-C rejects the PDU Session/PDN connection indicating the cause being the number of UEs in the network slice has been exceeded.

In this case the AMF is not configured for this S-NSSAI to be subject to NSAC. As an optimization option, the SMF+PGW-C can be configured not to trigger the Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfUEsUpdate_Request to NSACF. - When the NSACF receives request to increase the current number of PDU Session/PDN Connection established for the network slice, the NSACF checks whether this is the first PDU Session/PDN Connection associated with the network slice. If this is the first PDU Session/PDN Connection associated with the network slice the NSACF checks whether the maximum number of UEs with at least one PDU Session/PDN Connection has been reached. If the maximum number has not been reached then the NSACF increases the number of UE with at least one PDU session/PDN connection and add an entry for UE ID. If the maximum number of UEs has already been reached, unless operator policy implements a different action, the SMF+PGW-C rejects the PDU Session/PDN connection indicating the cause being the number of UEs in the network slice has been exceeded. - When the NSACF receives request to decrease the current number of PDU Session/PDN Connection established for the network slice, the NSACF locates the UE entry, checks whether this is the last PDU Session/PDN Connection associated with the network slice for the UE. If it is the last PDU Session/PDN Connection the NSACF decreases the number of UE with at least one PDU session/PDN connection and remove the associated UE entry. NOTE 1: A PLMN can deploy one of the above two options for a slice when EPS counting is required for a network slice and NSACF is configured with maximum number of UEs with at least one PDU Session/PDN Connection. NSACF is configured with the information of whether the NSAC for number of UEs with at least one PDU session/PDN connection is based on Option1 or Option 2.

During an active MBS multicast session, the UE is required to resume RRC connection to get the PTM configuration if the PTM configuration is not provided on the multicast MCCH of the new cell. Even if the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state received indication to stop monitoring PDCCH addressed by G-RNTI for an MBS multicast session in the source cell, the UE acquires MCCH in the reselected cell after cell reselection.

This allows the UE, e.g., to resume RRC connection without reading SIB24 and multicast MCCH of the neighbour cell, if the interested service which is activated is not available to the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state. The gNB may provide an indication on cell PDCP COUNT synchronization for an MBS session with PTM configuration in RRCRelease message.

DCI,Downlink Control Information,Message,V,"In Multiple Transmit/Receive Point (multi-TRP) operation, a serving cell can schedule the UE from two TRPs, providing better coverage, reliability and/or data rates for PDSCH, PDCCH, PUSCH, and PUCCH. There are two different operation modes to schedule multi-TRP PDSCH transmissions: single-DCI and multi-DCI. For both modes, control of uplink and downlink operation can be done by physical layer and MAC layer, within the configuration provided by the RRC layer. In single-DCI mode, the UE is scheduled by the same DCI for both TRPs and in multi-DCI mode, the UE is scheduled by independent DCIs from each TRP. There are two different operation modes for multi-TRP PDCCH: PDCCH repetition as in Clause 5.2.3 and Single Frequency Network (SFN) based PDCCH transmission. In both modes, the UE can receive two PDCCH transmissions, one from each TRP, carrying the same DCI. In PDCCH repetition mode, the UE can receive the two PDCCH transmissions carrying the same DCI from two linked search spaces each associated with a different CORESET. In SFN based PDCCH transmission mode, the UE can receive the two PDCCH transmissions carrying the same DCI from a single search space/CORESET using different TCI states. For multi-TRP PUSCH repetition, according to indications in a single DCI or in a semi-static configured grant provided over RRC, the UE performs PUSCH transmission of the same contents toward two TRPs with corresponding beam directions associated with different spatial relations. For multi-TRP PUCCH repetition, the UE performs PUCCH transmission of the same contents toward two TRPs with corresponding beam directions associated with different spatial relations. For inter-cell multi-TRP operation, for multi-DCI PDSCH transmission, one or more TCI states can be associated with SSB with a PCI different from the serving cell PCI. The activated TCI states can be associated with at most one PCI different from the serving cell PCI at a time. For inter-cell and intra-cell multi-DCI multi-TRP operation, up to two TAGs with associated TAG IDs can be configured per serving cell. Each UL/Joint TCI state is associated with a TAG ID and the UE applies the timing advance of the TAG ID associated with the UL/joint TCI state utilized for UL transmission. For single-DCI multi-TRP Simultaneous Transmission with Multi-Panel (STxMP) Spatial Domain Multiplexing (SDM) PUSCH transmission, different layers of one PUSCH are separately transmitted towards two TRPs. For single-DCI multi-TRP STxMP SFN PUSCH transmission, same layers of one PUSCH are transmitted towards two TRPs. For multi-DCI based multi-TRP STxMP PUSCH+PUSCH transmission, two PUSCHs are transmitted towards two TRPs. For single-DCI multi-TRP STxMP SFN PUCCH transmission, one PUCCH is transmitted towards two TRPs.","Downlink Control Information (DCI) refers to the control signaling data transmitted from a base station to user equipment in the downlink direction.

ASR,Abort-Session-Request,Message,U,"Diameter is used as the protocol between the P-GW and a Diameter server or proxy for applications (e.g. MMS) to deliver information related to the user session. However some IP applications could need to interwork with the P-GW to release the corresponding resource (e.g. terminate a particular bearer or Resource Allocation Deactivation procedures as defined in TS 23.402 [78]). For this purpose, the Diameter server or proxy may send a Diameter ASR along with the EPS bearer ID, if available, to identify the particular bearer to be terminated to the P-GW. The P-GW should react by deleting the corresponding bearer. If the P-GW deletes the corresponding bearer, it need not wait for the response from the S-GW or trusted non-3GPP IP access or ePDG before sending the ASA to the server.
The absence of the EPS bearer ID in the Diameter ASR message indicates to the P-GW that all bearers/resources for this particular user and sharing the same user session shall be deleted.

GUTI,Globally Unique Temproary Identifier,Identifier,V,"The bearer modification procedure without bearer QoS update is used to update the TFT for an active default or dedicated bearer, to modify the APN-AMBR, to retrieve User Location from the MME, to inform PCO to UE or to instruct the MME (e.g. to activate/deactivate the location reporting). The procedure for a GTP based S5/S8 is depicted in figure 5.4.3-1. In this procedure there is no need to update the underlying radio bearer(s). This procedure may be triggered if the APN-AMBR is changed by the PCRF/PDN GW. Figure 5.4.3-1: Bearer Modification Procedure without Bearer QoS Update NOTE 1: Steps 3-8 are common for architecture variants with GTP based S5/S8 and PMIP-based S5/S8. For an PMIP-based S5/S8, procedure steps (A) and (B) are defined in TS 23.402[ Architecture enhancements for non-3GPP accesses ]  [2]. Steps 1, 2, 9 and 10 concern GTP based S5/S8. Steps 3-8 may also be used within the HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification. 1. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PCRF sends a PCC decision provision (QoS policy) message to the PDN GW. This corresponds to the beginning of the PCRF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure or to the PCRF response in the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.203[ Policy and charging control architecture ]  [6], up to the point that the PDN GW requests IP-CAN Bearer Signalling. The PCC decision provision message may indicate that User Location Information and/or UE Time Zone Information is to be provided to the PCRF as defined in TS 23.203[ Policy and charging control architecture ]  [6]. If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply local QoS policy. 2. The PDN GW uses this QoS policy to determine that a service data flow shall be aggregated to or removed from an active bearer. The PDN GW generates the TFT and determines that no update of the EPS Bearer QoS is needed. The PDN GW then sends the Update Bearer Request (PTI, EPS Bearer Identity, APN-AMBR, TFT, Retrieve Location) message to the Serving GW. The Procedure Transaction Id (PTI) parameter is used when the procedure was initiated by a UE Requested Bearer Resource Modification procedure - see clause 5.4.5. ""Retrieve Location"" is indicated if requested by the PCRF. If the PDN GW initiated bearer modification procedure was triggered by a UE requested bearer resource modification procedure and if 3GPP PS Data Off UE Status was present in the Bearer Resource Command PCO, the PDN GW shall include the 3GPP PS Data Off Support Indication in the Update Bearer Request PCO. 3. The Serving GW sends the Update Bearer Request (PTI, EPS Bearer Identity, APN-AMBR, TFT, Retrieve Location) message to the MME. If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state (and extended idle mode DRX is not enabled) the MME will trigger the Network Triggered Service Request from step 3 (which is specified in clause 5.3.4.3). In that case the following steps 4-7 may be combined into Network Triggered Service Request procedure or be performed stand-alone. If both the PCO and the TFT are absent and the APN-AMBR has not been modified, the MME shall skip the following steps 4-7. If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state and extended idle mode DRX is enabled for the UE, the MME will trigger Network Triggered Service Request from step 3 (which is specified in clause 5.3.4.3) and start a timer which is configured to a value smaller than the GTP re-transmission timer. If the MME receives no response from the UE before the timer expires, the MME sends an Update Bearer Response with a rejection cause indicating that UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving and then sets the internal flag Pending Network Initiated PDN Connection Signalling. The rejection is forwarded by the Serving GW to the PDN GW. In this case, the steps 4-9 are skipped. NOTE 2: If ISR is activated and the Serving GW does not have a downlink S1-U and the SGSN has notified the Serving GW that the UE has moved to PMM-IDLE or STANDBY state, the Serving GW sends Downlink Data Notification to trigger MME and SGSN to page the UE (as specified in clause 5.3.4.3) before sending the Update Bearer Request message. NOTE 3: The PCO can be set by the PDN GW in accordance with the TS 23.380[ IMS Restoration Procedures ]  [75]. 4. The MME builds a Session Management Request message including the TFT, APN-AMBR, EPS Bearer Identity and a WLAN offloadability indication. The MME then sends a Downlink NAS Transport (Session Management Configuration) message to the eNodeB. If the APN AMBR has changed, the MME may also update the UE AMBR. And if the UE-AMBR is updated, the MME signal a modified UE-AMBR value to the eNodeB by using S1-AP UE Context Modification Procedure. The MME may include an indication whether the traffic of this PDN Connection is allowed to be offloaded to WLAN as described in clause 4.3.23. 5. The eNodeB sends the Direct Transfer (Session Management Request) message to the UE. The UE uses the uplink packet filter (UL TFT) to determine the mapping of traffic flows to the radio bearer. The UE stores the modified APN-AMBR value and sets the MBR parameter of the corresponding non-GBR PDP contexts (of this PDN connection) to the new value. The UE shall set its TIN to ""GUTI"" if the modified EPS bearer was established before ISR activation. 6. The UE NAS layer builds a Session Management Response including EPS Bearer Identity. The UE then sends a Direct Transfer (Session Management Response) message to the eNodeB. 7. The eNodeB sends an Uplink NAS Transport (Session Management Response) message to the MME. 8. If the procedure is performed without steps 4-7 and location retrieval is requested and the UE is ECM_CONNECTED and unless the MME is configured not to retrieve ECGI from the eNodeB under this condition, the MME uses the Location Reporting Procedure described in clause 5.9.1 to retrieve the ECGI from the eNodeB. The MME acknowledges the bearer modification to the Serving GW by sending an Update Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity, User Location Information (ECGI)) message. The MME includes the last known User Location information. NOTE 4: Based on operator policy and local regulation the MME may, instead of using the Location Reporting Procedure described in clause 5.9.1 to retrieve the ECGI from the eNodeB, use the last known User Location information obtained from e.g. attach procedure, tracking area update procedure, etc. 9. The Serving GW acknowledges the bearer modification to the PDN GW by sending an Update Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity, User Location Information (ECGI)) message. 10. If the bearer modification procedure was triggered by a PCC Decision Provision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the PCRF whether the requested PCC decision (QoS policy) could be enforced or not by sending a Provision Ack message. This then allows the PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure or the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.203[ Policy and charging control architecture ]  [6] to continue and eventually conclude, proceeding after the completion of IP-CAN bearer signalling. If requested by the PCRF the PDN GW indicates User Location Information and/or UE Time Zone Information to the PCRF as defined in TS 23.203[ Policy and charging control architecture ]  [6]. If the bearer modification is rejected with a cause indicating that the UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving, then the PDN GW re-attempts the same procedure after it receives the indication that the is UE available for end to end signalling in the subsequent Modify Bearer Request message. NOTE 5: The exact signalling of step 1 and 10 (e.g. for local break-out) is outside the scope of this specification. This signalling and its interaction with the bearer activation procedure are to be specified in TS 23.203[ Policy and charging control architecture ]  [6]. Steps 1 and 10 are included here only for completeness.","The Globally Unique Temporary Identifier (GUTI) is a concept used in telecommunications, specifically in the context of bearer modification procedures without bearer QoS updates. It involves updating the TFT for an active default or dedicated bearer, modifying the APN-AMBR, retrieving User Location from the MME, informing PCO to UE, or instructing the MME to activate/deactivate location reporting.","The GUTI is classified under the entity type Identifier because it is a specific term used in the telecommunications industry, referring to a unique identifier with a particular role and functionality in the context of bearer modification procedures.",3GPP TS 23.401,5.4.3 PDN GW initiated bearer modification without bearer QoS update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNN,Data Network Name,Identifier,V,"L2TP may be used between UPF and the DN via N6 to carry traffic of a PDU Session, as defined in TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2]. The corresponding high level end to end signalling flow is described in this clause and further refined in TS 29.561[ 5G System; Interworking between 5G Network and external Data Networks; Stage 3 ]  [63]. For the procedure described below, it is a prerequisite that the UE is already registered to the 5GC and both SMF and UPF support the L2TP feature. NOTE 1: The scenario where the UE sends actual PPP frames/signalling towards the LAC, which involves back and forth message exchanges between the UE and LAC, for example for LCP Negotiation, is not in the scope of the present document. NOTE 2: The UE does not need to be aware of the L2TP procedure. Figure 4.3.2.4-1: Support of L2TP 1. This step is the same as step 1 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 or step 1 in clause 4.3.2.2.2. The PDU session establishment may include in the PCO information authentication information for PAP and/or CHAP. 2. The SMF may determine that an L2TP session is required for the PDU Session based on local configuration (e.g. related with DNN/S-NSSAI). The SMF may retrieve the L2TP Tunnel parameters from the DN-AAA Server, as described in clause 4.3.2.3, or be configured locally with L2TP Tunnel parameters. The L2TP Tunnel parameters may include information such as the LNS addressing information (e.g. IP address or hostname), as defined in TS 29.561[ 5G System; Interworking between 5G Network and external Data Networks; Stage 3 ]  [63]. 3. This step is the same as step 8 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following additions: If L2TP is required for the PDU Session, the SMF selects a UPF supporting L2TP. 4. This step is the same as step 10a in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following additions: The SMF requests the UPF to setup an L2TP Session towards the L2TP server (LNS). The SMF may send to the UPF as part of N4 signalling, L2TP Tunnel Information and L2TP Session Information to setup a L2TP session. The L2TP Session Information includes specific information related to the PDU Session, e.g. a Calling Number which may be set to UE's SUPI, the Called Number for the L2TP Session which may be configured to contain the DNN, PAP/CHAP related parameters if included by the UE in PCO in step 1 etc. This information is defined in TS 29.561[ 5G System; Interworking between 5G Network and external Data Networks; Stage 3 ]  [63]. 5. If needed the UPF may decide to setup a new L2TP Tunnel, as described in TS 29.561[ 5G System; Interworking between 5G Network and external Data Networks; Stage 3 ]  [63]. If the UPF decides to use an already existing L2TP Tunnel for the requested PDU Session from the SMF, it directly proceeds with step 6 below. 6. The UPF proceeds with L2TP Session setup towards the LNS, as described in TS 29.561[ 5G System; Interworking between 5G Network and external Data Networks; Stage 3 ]  [63]. If the SMF has requested the UPF to allocate the UE IP address in step 4, the UPF may retrieve the UE IP address from the LNS. 7. This step is the same as step 10b in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following additions: The status of the L2TP Session setup is sent by the UPF to the SMF in a N4 Session Establishment Response.

G-RNTI,Group-Radio Network Temporary Identifier,Identifier,V,"Mobility procedures for multicast reception allow the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state to continue receiving MBS service(s) when changing cells without resuming RRC connection if the PTM configuration of the new cell can be acquired by the UE from the multicast MCCH after cell reselection. During an active MBS multicast session, the UE is required to resume RRC connection to get the PTM configuration if the PTM configuration is not provided on the multicast MCCH of the new cell. Even if the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state received indication to stop monitoring PDCCH addressed by G-RNTI for an MBS multicast session in the source cell, the UE acquires MCCH in the reselected cell after cell reselection. The gNB may indicate in the multicast MCCH the list of neighbour cells providing the same MBS multicast service(s) for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state as provided in the serving cell. This allows the UE, e.g., to resume RRC connection without reading SIB24 and multicast MCCH of the neighbour cell, if the interested service which is activated is not available to the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state. The gNB may provide an indication on cell PDCP COUNT synchronization for an MBS session with PTM configuration in RRCRelease message. If indicated by the gNB, all cells within the RNA are synchronized in terms of PDCP COUNT value to the MRBs of the corresponding MBS service, and the order of MRBs within the list of multicast MRB configuration for the same MBS multicast session in the multicast MCCH message of the last serving cell and (re)selected cell within the RNA should be consistent. Upon reselection to a cell indicated as synchronized in terms of PDCP COUNT value, the UE does not initialize the PDCP state variables. Otherwise, the UE initializes the PDCP state variables as defined in TS 38.323[ NR; Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) specification ]  [8]. The UE may be configured with dedicated frequency priorities in RRCRelease message which the UE applies during cell reselection while receiving data of MBS multicast session in RRC_INACTIVE state.

GIN,Group Identifier for Network,Identifier,V,"The NG-RAN node is aware of the SNPN ID(s) supported by neighbour cells. At the time of handover, cells that do not support the serving SNPN ID or the SNPN ID of an equivalent SNPN within the mobility restrictions received in the UE context are not considered as candidate target cells by the source NG-RAN node. The target NG-RAN node performs access control. In case it cannot accept the handover for the serving SNPN the target NG-RAN node fails the handover including an appropriate cause value. 16.6.3 Self-Configuration for SNPN Self-configuration is described in clause 15. In addition, on NG, the NG-RAN node signals the SNPN ID(s) supported per tracking area and the AMF signals the SNPN ID(s) supported per node; on Xn, NG-RAN nodes exchange SNPN ID(s) supported per cell. 16.6.4 Access Control During the establishment of the UE-associated logical NG-connection towards the 5GC, the AMF checks whether the UE is allowed to access the cell for the signalled SNPN ID as specified in TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3].

For this purpose, the AAA server or proxy may send a RADIUS Disconnect Request to the P-GW. On receipt of the Disconnect-Request from the AAA server, the P-GW shall release the corresponding resources and reply with a Disconnect-ACK. If the P-GW is unable to release the corresponding resources, it shall reply to the AAA server with a Disconnect-NAK. For more information on RADIUS Disconnect, see IETF RFC 3576 [41].

The Teardown-Indicator in the RADIUS Disconnect Request message indicates to the P-GW that all IP-CAN bearers for this particular user and sharing the same user session shall be deleted. The IP-CAN bearers that belong to the same IP-CAN session are identified by the Acct-Session-Id. The Charging-Id contained in the Acct-Session-Id can be of any IP-CAN bearer of the user. The P-GW is able to find out all the related IP-CAN bearers sharing the same user session once it has found the exact IP-CAN bearer from the Acct-Session-Id.

BSIC,Base Station Identity Code,Identifier,V,"A BSIC is allocated to each cell. A BSIC can take one of 64 values. In each cell the BSIC is broadcast in each burst sent on the SCH, and is then known by all MSs which synchronise with this cell. The BSIC is used by the MS for several purposes, all aiming at avoiding ambiguity or interference which can arise when an MS in a given position can receive signals from two cells using the same BCCH frequency. Some of the uses of the BSIC relate to cases where the MS is attached to one of the cells. Other uses relate to cases where the MS is attached to a third cell, usually somewhere between the two cells in question. The first category of uses includes: - The three least significant bits of the BSIC indicate which of the 8 training sequences is used in the bursts sent on the downlink common channels of the cell. Different training sequences allow for a better transmission if there is interference. The group of the three least significant bits of the BSIC is called the BCC (Base station Colour Code). - The BSIC is used to modify the bursts sent by the MSs on the access bursts. This aims to avoid one cell correctly decoding access bursts sent to another cell. The second category of uses includes: - When in connected mode, the MSs measure and report the level they receive on a number of frequencies, corresponding to the BCCH frequencies of neighbouring cells in the same network as the used cell. Along with the measurement result, the MS sends to the network the BSIC which it has received on that frequency. This enables the network to discriminate between several cells which happen to use the same BCCH frequency. Poor discrimination might result in faulty handovers. - The content of the measurement report messages is limited to information for 6 neighbour cells. It is therefore useful to limit the reported cells to those to which handovers are accepted. For this purpose, each cell provides a list of the values of the three most significant bits of the BSICs which are allocated to the cells which are useful to consider for handovers (usually excluding cells in other PLMNs). This information enables the MS to discard information for cells with non-conformant BSICs and not to report them. The group of the three most significant bits of the BSIC is called the NCC (Network Colour Code). It should be noted that when in idle mode, the MS identifies a cell (for cell selection purposes) according to the cell identity broadcast on the BCCH and not by the BSIC.","The Base Station Identity Code (BSIC) is a unique identifier allocated to each cell in a mobile network.

In case a bidding down attack was attempted, the verification of the NAS SMC will fail and the UE replies with a reject message meaning that the UE will not attach to the network. Figure 6.7.2-1: NAS Security Mode Command procedure 1a. The AMF activates the NAS integrity protection before sending the NAS Security Mode Command message. 1b. The AMF sends the NAS Security Mode Command message to the UE. The NAS Security Mode Command message shall contain: the replayed UE security capabilities, the selected NAS algorithms, and the ngKSI for identifying the KAMF. The NAS Security Mode Command message may contain: K_AMF_change_flag (carried in the additional 5G security parameters IE specified in TS 24.501[ Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System (5GS); Stage 3 ]  [35]) to indicate a new KAMF is calculated, a flag requesting the complete initial NAS message (see subclause 6.4.6), Anti-Bidding down Between Architectures (ABBA) parameter. In the case of horizontal derivation of KAMF during mobility registration update or during multiple registration in same PLMN, K_AMF_change_flag shall be included in the NAS Security Mode Command message as described in clause 6.9.3. This message shall be integrity protected (but not ciphered) with NAS integrity key based on the KAMF indicated by the ngKSI in the NAS Security Mode Command message (see Figure 6.7.2-1). NOTE 2: Void. In case the network supports interworking using the N26 interface between MME and AMF, the AMF shall also include the selected EPS NAS algorithms (defined in Annex B of TS 33.401[ 3GPP System Architecture Evolution (SAE); Security architecture ]  [10]) to be used after mobility to EPS in the NAS Security Mode Command message (see clause 8.5.2). The UE shall store the algorithms for use after mobility to EPS using the N26 interface between MME and AMF. The AMF shall store the selected EPS NAS algorithms in the UE security context. NOTE 2a: When AMF change happens either due to N2-handover or idle mode mobility, the selected EPS NAS algorithms is always included in the 5G UE security context and provided to the target AMF as part of the 5G UE security context. 1c. The AMF activates NAS uplink deciphering after sending the NAS Security Mode Command message. 2a. The UE shall verify the NAS Security Mode Command message. This includes checking that the UE security capabilities sent by the AMF match the ones stored in the UE to ensure that these were not modified by an attacker and verifying the integrity protection using the indicated NAS integrity algorithm and the NAS integrity key based on the KAMF indicated by the ngKSI. In case the NAS Security Mode Command message includes a K_AMF_change_flag, the UE shall derive a new KAMF as described in Annex A.13 and set the NAS COUNTs to zero. If the verification of the integrity of the NAS Security Mode Command message is successful, the UE shall start NAS integrity protection and ciphering/deciphering with the security context indicated by the ngKSI. 2b. The UE sends the NAS Security Mode Complete message to the AMF ciphered and integrity protected. The NAS Security Mode Complete message shall include PEI in case AMF requested it in the NAS Security Mode Command message. The AMF shall set the NAS COUNTs to zero if horizontal derivation of KAMF is performed. The UE may include the complete initial NAS message (see subclause 6.4.6 for details). If the verification of the NAS Security Mode Command message is not successful in the UE, it shall reply with a NAS Security Mode Reject message (see TS 24.501[ Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System (5GS); Stage 3 ]  [35]). The NAS Security Mode Reject message and all subsequent NAS messages shall be protected with the previous, if any, 5G NAS security context, i.e., the 5G NAS security context used prior to the failed NAS Security Mode Command message. If no 5G NAS security context existed prior to the NAS Security Mode Command message, the NAS Security Mode Reject message shall remain unprotected. NOTE 2b: Void. The AMF shall de-cipher and check the integrity protection on the NAS Security Mode Complete message using the key and algorithm indicated in the NAS Security Mode Command message. NAS downlink ciphering at the AMF with this security context shall start after receiving the NAS Security Mode Complete message. 1d. The AMF activates NAS downlink ciphering. NOTE 3: If the uplink NAS COUNT will wrap around by sending the NAS Security Mode Reject message, the UE releases the NAS connection instead of sending the NAS Security Mode Reject message. NOTE 4: If the AMF successfully validated the NAS SMC Complete message, the AMF has successfully confirmed the SUPI received from the home network and the SUPI used by the UE match (as required in clause 5.5.3). However, integrity check failure of the NAS SMC Complete message at the AMF could have other causes than a mismatch of the SUPIs.","NAS Security Mode Command procedure is used to establish a secure connection between the UE and the AMF, involving the exchange of messages including the NAS Security Mode Command message and the NAS Security Mode Complete message.","The NAS Security Mode Command procedure is classified under the entity type 'Procedure' because it outlines a specific series of steps or actions taken to achieve a particular goal, in this case, establishing a secure connection between the UE and the AMF.",3GPP TS 33.501,6.7.2 NAS security mode command procedure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TEID,Tunnel Endpoint Identifier,Identifier,V,"GTP tunnels are used between two nodes communicating over a GTP based interface, to separate traffic into different communication flows. A GTP tunnel is identified in each node with a TEID, an IP address and a UDP port number. The receiving end side of a GTP tunnel locally assigns the TEID value the transmitting side has to use. The TEID value shall be assigned in a non-predictable manner for PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b interfaces (see 3GPP TS 33.250[ Security assurance specification for the PGW network product class ]  [85]). The TEID values are exchanged between tunnel endpoints using GTP-C or S1-MME or Iu-PS messages. The GTPv2 entity communicates to the peer GTPv2 entity the TEID value at which it expects to receive all subsequent control plane messages related to that GTP tunnel via the: - ""Sender F-TEID for Control Plane"" IE, - ""PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b F-TEID for PMIP based interface or for GTP based Control Plane interface"" IE, - ""MSC Server Sv TEID for Control Plane"" IE, - ""S3/S16/S10 Address and TEID for Control Plane"" IE, or - ""MME/SGSN Sv TEID for Control Plane"" IE. The criteria defining when the same or different GTP tunnels shall be used between the two nodes differs between the control and the user plane, and also between interfaces. For the control plane, for each end-point of a GTP-C tunnel: - The TEID-C shall be unique per PDN-Connection on GTP based S2a, S2b, S5 and S8 interfaces. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control messages related to all bearers associated to the PDN-Connection. A TEID-C on the S2a/S2b/S5/S8 interface shall be released after all its associated EPS bearers are deleted. - There shall be only one pair of TEID-Cs per UE on each of the S3, S10, S16 and N26 interfaces. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control messages related to the same UE operation. A TEID-C on the S3/S10/S16/N26 interface shall be released after its associated UE context is removed or the UE is detached. For the S3 interface, when ISR is active for the UE, during I-RAT handover between the ISR associated nodes, the existing S3 TEID-C may be re-used or new S3 TEID-C may be allocated. During this scenario, if the node decides to allocate new S3 TEID-C, it shall release its own old S3 TEID-C. - There shall be only one pair of TEID-C per UE over the S11 and the S4 interfaces. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control messages related to the same UE operation. A TEID-C on the S11/S4 interface shall be released after all its associated EPS bearers are deleted. - There shall be only one pair of TEID-C per MBMS Bearer Service (i.e. per TMGI and MBMS Flow Identifier, if the MBMS Flow Identifier is provided; or per TMGI, if the MBMS Flow Identifier is not provided) over the Sm and Sn interfaces respectively. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control messages related to the same MBMS Bearer Service. A TEID-C on the Sm/Sn interface shall be released after the MBMS Bearer Session is stopped. For GTP-U, a TEID-U is used according to 3GPP TS 29.281[ General Packet Radio System (GPRS) Tunnelling Protocol User Plane (GTPv1-U) ]  [13]. NOTE: GTP-U is based on GTP version 1 (GTPv1).","The Tunnel Endpoint Identifier (TEID) is a unique identifier used in the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) to identify and separate traffic into different communication flows within GTP tunnels. It is locally assigned by the receiving end of a GTP tunnel and exchanged between tunnel endpoints using specific messages, such as GTP-C or S1-MME messages. The TEID value must be assigned in a non-predictable manner for certain interfaces, like PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b, to ensure security. It plays a crucial role in managing control plane and user plane communications between nodes in the network.","TEID is classified as an Identifier because it serves as a unique value assigned to identify GTP tunnels and manage communication flows within those tunnels.

An AMF may subscribe with the UCMF to obtain from the UCMF new values of UE Radio Capability ID that the UCMF assigns for the purpose of caching them locally. Provisioning of Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID entries in the UCMF is performed from an AF that interacts with the UCMF either directly or via the NEF (or via Network Management) using a procedure defined in TS 23.502[ Procedures for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3]. A UCMF that serves both EPS and 5GS shall require provisioning the UE Radio Capability ID with the TS 36.331[ Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification ]  [51] format or TS 38.331[ NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification ]  [28] format or both the formats of the UE radio capabilities. The UCMF also assigns the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID values. Each PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is also associated to the TAC of the UE model(s) that it is related to. When an AMF requests the UCMF to assign a UE Radio Capability ID for a set of UE radio capabilities, it indicates the TAC of the UE that the UE Radio Capability information is related to. The UCMF stores a Version ID value for the PLMN assigned UE Radio Capability IDs so it is included in the PLMN assigned UE Radio Capability IDs it assigns. This shall be configured in the UCMF.

TA,Tracking Area,Identifier,V,"An eNodeB may connect to several MMEs. This implies that an eNodeB must be able to determine which of the MMEs, covering the area where an UE is located, should receive the signalling sent from a UE. To avoid unnecessary signalling in the core network, a UE that has attached to one MME should generally continue to be served by this MME as long as the UE is in the radio coverage of the pool area to which the MME is associated. The concept of pool area is a RAN based definition that comprises one or more TA(s) that, from a RAN perspective, are served by a certain group of MMEs. This does not exclude that one or more of the MMEs in this group serve TAs outside the pool area. This group of MMEs is also referred to as an MME pool. To enable the eNodeB to determine which MME to select when forwarding messages from an UE, this functionality defines a routing mechanism (and other related mechanism). A routing mechanism (and other related mechanism) is defined for the MMEs. The routing mechanism is required to find the correct old MME (from the multiple MMEs that are associated with a pool area). When a UE roams out of the pool area and into the area of one or more MMEs that do not know about the internal structure of the pool area where the UE roamed from, the new MME will send the Identification Request message or the Context Request message to the old MME using the GUTI. The routing mechanism in both the MMEs and the eNodeB utilises the fact that every MME that serves a pool area must have its own unique value range of the GUTI parameter within the pool area.","A Tracking Area (TA) is a geographical area served by one or more eNodeBs, which are connected to multiple MMEs. The TA is used as part of the concept of a pool area, a RAN-based definition that comprises one or more TAs served by a certain group of MMEs, also referred to as an MME pool.","TA is classified as an Identifier because it serves as a unique identifier for a geographical area within the network, allowing eNodeBs and MMEs to determine routing mechanisms and manage UE connections efficiently.",3GPP TS 23.401,4.3.10 Functionality for Connection of eNodeBs to Multiple MMEs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Figure 4.28.2.1-1: Subscription-based control of 5G access stratum-based time distribution 1. The UE performs the registration procedure as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2. The AMF retrieves the Access and Mobility Subscription data including the Access Stratum Time Synchronization Service Authorization. The Access and Mobility Subscription data may further include the Uu time synchronization error budget, one or more periods of start and stop times defining active times, a coverage area, clock quality detail level, and the acceptance criteria for the UE, as described in clause 5.27.1.11 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2]. As part of this, the AMF shall, if supported, store the 5G access stratum time distribution indication (enable, disable), the Uu time synchronization error budget, clock quality detail level and clock quality acceptance criteria, and the UE reconnection indication in the UE context in AMF. 2. The AMF performs the control according to the subscription data as follows. If the AMF receives start and stop times then the AMF sends the message to the NG-RAN to enable or disable the 5G access stratum time distribution according to the expiry of start and stop times if the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state. If the UE is in CM-IDLE state when a Start time condition is met, then the AMF pages the UE and provides the 5G access stratum distribution indication to NG-RAN as part of the subsequent service request procedure initiated by the UE in the response to the paging. If the AMF received Time Synchronization Coverage Area information as part of the Access and Mobility Subscription data including the Access Stratum Time Synchronization Service Authorization, the AMF determines if the Coverage Area information shall trigger an activation or deactivation of the access stratum time distribution: - If the UE has moved inside the Coverage Area, then the AMF determines to enable access stratum time distribution for the UE. - If the UE has moved outside the Coverage Area, then the AMF determines to disable access stratum time distribution for the UE.

The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store the information in the UE Context. Based on this information, the NG-RAN node provides the 5GS access stratum time to the UE according to the Uu time synchronization error budget as provided by the TSCTSF (if supported by UE and NG-RAN) and NG-RAN provides timing synchronization status reports to the UE (as described in clause 4.15.9.5.2).","CM-IDLE refers to a state of the User Equipment (UE) where it is not actively connected to the network but remains registered, allowing for efficient management of resources and quick reconnection when needed.","CM-IDLE is classified as a State because it describes a specific condition or status of the UE in relation to its connection with the network.

The MME may provide the unavailability period duration to the UE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME may consider the unavailability period duration if provided by the UE to determine the unavailability period duration of the UE.
If the UE provided unavailability information in the last tracking area updating procedure, the MME considers the UE unreachable until the UE registers for normal service without providing unavailability information. If the UE did not include a start of the unavailability period, the MME shall consider the start of the unavailability period to be the time at which MME received the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the UE. The MME may determine the value of the periodic tracking area update timer (T3412) provided to the UE based on the unavailability period duration and the start of the unavailability period, if available. The MME releases the NAS signalling connection after the completion of the attach procedure or the tracking area updating procedure in which the UE provided unavailability information.
If for discontinuous coverage the UE has stored a discontinuous coverage maximum time offset, upon returning in coverage after being out of coverage due to discontinuous coverage, the UE sets the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset value to a random value up to and including the stored discontinuous coverage maximum time offset for this PLMN and satellite E-UTRAN access and starts this timer. The UE shall not initiate any NAS signalling on that satellite E-UTRAN access and PLMN combination while the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset timer is running. The UE shall stop the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset timer and initiate NAS signalling if the UE receives a paging message, has pending emergency services, is establishing an emergency PDN connection, is performing emergency services fallback procedure or when the UE enters a new tracking area.
When the unavailability period is activated, all NAS timers are stopped and associated procedures aborted except for timers T3412, T3346, T3447, T3396, any back-off timers, T3247, and the timer T controlling the periodic search for HPLMN or EHPLMN or higher prioritized PLMNs (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]).
When the UE provides unavailability information using the tracking area updating procedure without providing the start of the unavailability period, then after successful completion of the procedure the UE may deactivate the access stratum and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE. Otherwise, if the UE provided the start of unavailability period, the UE may deactivate the access stratum and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE only after the start of the unavailability period.",This state indicates that the UE is registered with the network but cannot access any cell due to coverage issues.,Recognized as a State because it describes a specific operational condition of the UE.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3GPP TS 24.301

Figure 4.28.2.1-1: Subscription-based control of 5G access stratum-based time distribution 1. The UE performs the registration procedure as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2. The AMF retrieves the Access and Mobility Subscription data including the Access Stratum Time Synchronization Service Authorization. The Access and Mobility Subscription data may further include the Uu time synchronization error budget, one or more periods of start and stop times defining active times, a coverage area, clock quality detail level, and the acceptance criteria for the UE, as described in clause 5.27.1.11 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2]. As part of this, the AMF shall, if supported, store the 5G access stratum time distribution indication (enable, disable), the Uu time synchronization error budget, clock quality detail level and clock quality acceptance criteria, and the UE reconnection indication in the UE context in AMF. 2. The AMF performs the control according to the subscription data as follows. If the AMF receives start and stop times then the AMF sends the message to the NG-RAN to enable or disable the 5G access stratum time distribution according to the expiry of start and stop times if the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state. If the UE is in CM-IDLE state when a Start time condition is met, then the AMF pages the UE and provides the 5G access stratum distribution indication to NG-RAN as part of the subsequent service request procedure initiated by the UE in the response to the paging. If the AMF received Time Synchronization Coverage Area information as part of the Access and Mobility Subscription data including the Access Stratum Time Synchronization Service Authorization, the AMF determines if the Coverage Area information shall trigger an activation or deactivation of the access stratum time distribution: - If the UE has moved inside the Coverage Area, then the AMF determines to enable access stratum time distribution for the UE. - If the UE has moved outside the Coverage Area, then the AMF determines to disable access stratum time distribution for the UE. The AMF determines whether the UE moves inside/outside of the Coverage Area specified in the clause 5.27.1.11 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2] The AMF shall send the UE reconnection indication to the UE updating the UE configuration as defined in clause 4.2.2 or clause 4.2.4.2. 3.

The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store the information in the UE Context. Based on this information, the NG-RAN node provides the 5GS access stratum time to the UE according to the Uu time synchronization error budget as provided by the TSCTSF (if supported by UE and NG-RAN) and NG-RAN provides timing synchronization status reports to the UE (as described in clause 4.15.9.5.2).","CM-CONNECTED refers to a state of the User Equipment (UE) where it is connected to the network and has an active connection, enabling it to receive services such as access stratum time distribution.

Triggers for the UE to initiate this procedure are defined in clause 5.3.3.2.5 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2]. Figure 4.8.2.2-1: Connection Resume in RRC_INACTIVE 1. UE to NG-RAN: RRC message (Resume ID). The UE initiates connection resume from RRC_INACTIVE state, see TS 38.300[ NR; NR and NG-RAN Overall description; Stage-2 ]  [9]. The UE provides its Resume ID needed by the NG-RAN to access the UE's stored Context. 2. [Conditional] NG-RAN performs UE Context Retrieval. UE Context Retrieval is performed when the UE Context associated with the UE attempting to resume its connection is not locally available at the accessed NG-RAN. The UE Context Retrieval procedure via NG-RAN is specified in TS 38.300[ NR; NR and NG-RAN Overall description; Stage-2 ]  [9]. 3. NG-RAN to UE: RRC messages. NG-RAN determines whether the UE shall be transitioned to RRC_CONNECTED state or kept in RRC_INACTIVE (e.g. the latter in the case of Small Data Transmission as defined in TS 38.300[ NR; NR and NG-RAN Overall description; Stage-2 ]  [9]). 4a. [Conditional] N2 Path switch procedure. If the accessed NG-RAN is able to retrieve the UE Context, the accessed NG-RAN node initiates N2 Path Switch procedure, i.e. steps 1 to 8 of clause 4.9.1.2.2 and including Xn data forwarding. If the Connection Resume procedure is a response to RAN paging which is triggered by 5GC due to an N2 interface procedure, NG-RAN and 5GC handle the N2 interface procedure as a collision described in clause 4.9.1.2. If Connection Inactive procedure with CN based MT communication handling (see clause 4.8.1.1a) has been performed previously then when the path switch procedure is performed downlink data or signalling delivery is triggered, if there is any. 4b. [Conditional] N2 Notification, 4b.1 If the accessed NG-RAN is the same as the NG-RAN that configured RRC_INACTIVE and still has the UE context, NG-RAN sends: - an N2 Notification to the AMF indicating the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED, if an AMF requested N2 Notification (see clause 4.8.3); or - an MT Communication Handling request to the AMF indicating the UE is now reachable for downlink data and/or signalling if Connection Inactive procedure with CN based MT communication handling (see clause 4.8.1.1a) has been performed previously. 4b.2 The AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request towards SMF indicating the Downlink data delivery for each PDU session with active user plane, if the AMF has requested data buffering as described in clause 4.8.1.1a. 4b.3 N4 session modification procedure is triggered by the SMF. If data buffering is handled in the UPF, the SMF updates the UPF with appropriate rules to trigger data delivery. 4b.4 The SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response. 4b.5 The AMF sends the N2 MT Communication Handling response message to NG-RAN. If NG-RAN determines that the connection resume is for Small Data Transmission as defined in TS 38.300[ NR; NR and NG-RAN Overall description; Stage-2 ]  [9] and step 4a or steps 4b.1 to 4b.5 have been performed, then NG-RAN keeps the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state and the UL/DL Small Data are transferred via the NG-RAN. Based on the procedures defined in TS 38.300[ NR; NR and NG-RAN Overall description; Stage-2 ]  [9], if the UE is re-configured with RRC Inactive with eDRX>10.24s, the NG-RAN may send an N2 message to 5GC as described in step 2 in clause 4.8.1.1a so the CN can then handle mobile terminated (MT) communication.","Mobile Terminated (MT) refers to a type of State where the network initiates or terminates a connection with the User Equipment (UE).

1.        The GGSN receives an IGMP (IPv4) or MLD (IPv6) Join message from a UE, over the default PDP context to signal its interest in receiving a particular multicast MBMS bearer service identified by an IP multicast address.
2.        The GGSN sends an AAR seeking authorization for the activating UE to receive data from a particular service.
3.        The authorization decision is provided in the AAA together with the APN to be used for creation of the MBMS UE context. If the AAA indicates that the UE is not authorized to receive the MBMS data the process terminates with no additional message exchange.
4.        The GGSN sends an MBMS Notification Request (IP multicast address, APN, Linked NSAPI) to the SGSN. Linked NSAPI is set equal to the NSAPI of the PDP context over which the Join request was received. The IP multicast address is the one requested by the UE in the Join request. The APN may be different from the APN to which the default PDP context has been activated. In any case, the APN may resolve to a GGSN that is different from the GGSN receiving the IGMP/MLD Join request. The GGSN starts a MBMS Activation Timer as GGSN may receive no response, e.g. in case SGSN or UE does not support MBMS.
5.        The SGSN sends a MBMS Notification Response (Cause) to the GGSN that sent the MBMS Notification Request, where Cause shall indicate successful or unsuccessful MBMS context activation for the reason of SGSN or UE . Upon reception of the response message with Cause indicating unsuccessful operation or time-out of the MBMS Activation Timer in the GGSN, the GGSN may fallback to IP multicast access as defined in clause 11.7.
6.        The SGSN creates an MBMS UE context and sends a Create MBMS Context Requests (IP multicast address, APN, RAI) to the GGSN. That GGSN may be different from the GGSN receiving the IGMP/MLD Join request.

PMIP,Proxy Mobile IPv6,Protocol,V,"In current LAN environments the most commonly used configuration protocol is DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, RFC 2131 [26]) and DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6, IETF RFC 3315 [46]). It provides a mechanism for passing a large set of configuration parameters to hosts connected to a TCP/IP network (IP address, sub-net mask, domain name, MTU, etc.) in an automatic manner. Moreover DHCP may assign IP addresses to clients for a finite lease time, allowing for sequential reassignment of addresses to different users.
The lease time is chosen by the administrator of the DHCP server (in the external network), and is therefore out of the scope of the present document.
The Packet Domain may obtain IP address via external DHCP server during the packet bearer establishment procedures (e.g. PDP Context activation, default bearer establishment). The GGSN/P-GW acts as a DHCP client towards the external DHCP server.
The Packet Domain offers the end user the possibility to run DHCP end-to-end the same way as he does when connected directly to a LAN (e.g. an enterprise Intranet). No modifications should be required in common implementations of DHCP clients and servers. However in non-EPC based Packet Domain, a DHCP relay agent function is needed in the GGSN so as to allow correct routing of DHCP requests and replies between the TE and the DHCP servers. In EPC based Packet Domain for 3GPP access networks, the P-GW acts a DHCP server towards the UE and it acts as a DHCP client towards the external DHCP server. For trusted non-3GPP access networks, the non-3GPP access network may act as a DHCP relay or DHCP server. In the trusted WLAN access network, the TWAN acts a DHCP server towards the UE and PGW acts as a DHCP client towards the external DHCP server for the GTP/PMIP-based S2a.
In non-EPC based Packet Domain,at PDP context activation no IP address is allocated, this is done afterwards through DHCP. After the TE’s configuration has been completed by DHCP, the PDP context is updated by means of the GGSN-initiated PDP Context Modification Procedure in order to reflect the newly assigned IP address.
In the following cases the bearer associated with the allocated IP address (i.e. IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix) shall be released:
-        if the DHCP lease expires;

BAP,Backhaul Adaptation Protocol,Protocol,U,"Fig. 4.7.2-1 shows the protocol stack for F1-U and Fig. 4.7.2-2 shows the protocol stack for F1-C between IAB-DU and IAB-donor-CU. In these figures, F1-U and F1-C are carried over two backhaul hops. F1-U and F1-C use an IP transport layer between IAB-DU and IAB-donor-CU as defined in TS 38.470[ NG-RAN; F1 general aspects and principles ]  [32]. F1-U and F1-C need to be security-protected as described in TS 33.501[ Security architecture and procedures for 5G System ]  [5] (the security layer is not shown in the Figures 4.7.2-1/2). On the wireless backhaul, the IP layer is carried over the Backhaul Adaptation Protocol (BAP) sublayer, which enables routing over multiple hops. The IP layer can also be used for non-F1 traffic, such as OAM traffic as defined in TS 38.401[ NG-RAN; Architecture description ]  [4]. On each backhaul link, the BAP PDUs are carried by BH RLC channels. Multiple BH RLC channels can be configured on each BH link to allow traffic prioritization and QoS enforcement. The BH-RLC-channel mapping for BAP PDUs is performed by the BAP entities on each IAB-node and the IAB-donor-DU. Protocol stacks for an IAB-donor with split gNB architecture are specified in TS 38.401[ NG-RAN; Architecture description ]  [4].

For IAB-nodes operating in EN-DC, the IAB-MT establishes one or more DRBs with the eNB and one or more DRBs with the IAB-donor-CU, which can be used, e.g., to carry OAM traffic. For SA mode, the establishment of DRBs is optional. These SRBs and DRBs are transported between the IAB-MT and its parent node over Uu access channel(s). The protocol stacks for the SRB is shown in Fig. 4.7.2-3.

NCP,Network Control Protocol,Protocol,V,"In this case:
-        the MS is given an address belonging to the Intranet/ISP addressing space. The address is given either at subscription in which case it is a static address or at PDP context activation in which case it is a dynamic address. This address is used for packet forwarding within the GGSN and for packet forwarding on the Intranet/ISP. This requires a link between the GGSN and an address allocation server, such as AAA, or DHCP, belonging to the Intranet/ISP;
-        the communication between the Packet Domain and the Intranet/ISP may be performed over any network, even an insecure e.g. the Internet. In case of an insecure connection between the GGSN and the Intranet/ISP there may be a specific security protocol in between. This security protocol is defined by mutual agreement between PLMN operator and Intranet/ISP administrator.
The following description bullet items describe the signal flow.
1)        The TE sends an AT-command to the MT to set up parameters.
2)        The MT sends the Activate PDP context request message to the SGSN which sends the Create PDP context request message to the chosen GGSN.
3)        The GGSN deduces from the APN:
-        the server(s) to be used for address allocation and authentication;
-        the protocol such as RADIUS, DHCP or L2TP to be used with this / those server(s);
-        the communication and security feature needed to dialogue with this / those server(s) e.g. tunnel ,IPSec security association, dial-up connection (using possibly PPP).
As an example the GGSN may use one of the following options:
-        RADIUS for authentication and IP-address allocation. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the GGSN;
-        RADIUS for authentication and DHCP for host configuration and address allocation. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the GGSN. After a successful authentication, the DHCP client discovers the DHCP server(s) in the ISP/Intranet and receives host configuration data;
-        L2TP for forwarding PPP frames to a L2TP Network Server.
4)        The GGSN sends back to the SGSN a Create PDP Context Response message.
5)        Depending on the cause value received in the Create PDP Context Response the SGSN may either send the Activate PDP Context Accept message or send the Activate PDP Context Reject message to the MS.
6)        The MT responds with an AT-response that may indicate whether the context activation was successful or not. In the case of a non-successful context activation the response may also indicate the cause.
In case of a successful context activation, the TE will start its PPP protocol after the LLC link has been established. The LCP, Authentication and NCP negotiations are then carried out. During these negotiations the GGSN may acknowledge values, for any LCP options related to ‘L2’ framing (e.g. ‘ACCM’, ‘ACFC’ and ‘FCS-Alternatives’), as proposed by the MT, which itself is forwarding these negotiations from the TE.
NOTE:        With the <PDP Type>""PPP"" the MT may provide a PPP relay (or proxy) function between the TE and GGSN. This gives the opportunity for the MT to intercept the ‘L2’ framing end to end negotiations.
EXAMPLE:        In the following example the successful PDP context activation is shown.

In order to have forward compatible type definitions for the GTPv2 information elements, all of them shall be TLIV (Type, Length, Instance, Value) coded. GTPv2 information element type values are specified in the Table 8.1-1. The last column of this table indicates whether the information element is: - Fixed Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and a fixed number of octets. - Variable Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and has a variable number of octets. For example, the last octets may be numbered similar to ""5 to (n+4)"". In this example, if the value of the length field, n, is 0, then the last field is not present. - Extendable: the IE has a variable number of fields, and has a variable number of octets. The last fields are typically specified with the statement: ""These octet(s) is/are present only if explicitly specified"". The legacy receiving entity shall ignore the unknown octets.

GTP-U,GPRS Tunneling Protocol for User Plane,Protocol,V,"Gi/SGi PtP tunnelling based on UDP/IP may be used to deliver Non-IP data to an AS via Gi/SGi.
The PtP tunnel is set up by configuration of tunnel parameters in both end of the tunnel.
The following parameters are pre-configured in the GGSN/P-GW per APN;
-	the UDP destination port number to use when sending Non-IP data;
-	the UDP port number it wants to receive Non-IP data;
-	the destination IP address to be used for sending Non-IP data.
NOTE 1:	Many APNs can resolve to the same P-GW, but each APN can be unique to a particular AS.
The following is pre-configured in the AS;
-	the UDP destination port number to use when sending Non-IP data;
-	the UDP port number it wants to receive Non-IP data.
NOTE 2:	The GGSN/P-GW as well as the AS can use any UDP port numbers not assigned by IANA. The port numbers used need to be aligned between peers.
IP address allocation procedures for the UE (i.e. PDN connection) are performed by the GGSN/P-GW as described in subclause 11.2.2. 
The UE IP address for the PDN connection or IPv6 prefix allocated for the PDN connection+suffix assigned for the PtP tunnel end point in the GGSN/P-GW is used as source address in the GGSN/P-GW and as destination address in the AS for the PtP tunnel.
During the PDP context/PDN connection establishment, the GGSN/P-GW associates the GTP-U tunnel for the PDP context/PDN connection with the Gi/SGi PtP tunnel. The GTP-U tunnel with PDP/PDN type “Non-IP” is used.
The GGSN/P-GW acts as a transparent forwarding node between the UE used for CIoT and the AS.
NOTE 3:	The UE can include application level identity to AS, what kind of identity is out of scope of this specification.
For uplink delivery, if the uplink data is received from the GTP-U tunnel the GGSN/P-GW shall forward the received data to the AS over the Gi/SGi PtP tunnel associated with the GTP-U tunnel using UDP/IP encapsulation with the destination address of the AS and the configured UDP destination port number for “Non-IP” data as described above.
For downlink delivery, the AS shall send the data using UDP/IP encapsulation with the IP address or IPv6 prefix+suffix of the UE as destination address and the configured UDP destination port number for “Non-IP” data as described above.
NOTE 3:	The UDP source port number to use for both uplink and downlink Non-IP data transfer can be a pre-configured or a locally allocated port number in the GGSN/P-GW and AS respectively.
NOTE 4:	For downlink delivery, the GGSN/P-GW decapsulates the received data (i.e. removes the UDP/IP headers) and forwards the data to SGSN/S-GW on the GTP-U tunnel identified by the IP address or the IPv6 prefix of the UE (i.e. PDN connection) for delivery to the UE.

DSMIPv6,Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6,Protocol,V,"3GPP and non-3GPP accesses provide IP services for a MS/UE. The GGSN/P-GW endpoint is a GTPv1-U tunnel (controlled by GTP Gn/Gp or S5/S8/S2a/S2b) or IP tunnel (controlled by S5/S8/S2a/S2b PMIPv6 or employed by a UE with MIPv4 or DSMIPv6).
The MTU of the IP tunnel on the MS/UE side of the IP link may be different than the MTU of the IP link connecting the GGSN/P-GW to the PDN. As a result IP packets crossing the Gi/Sgi interface may need to be fragmented. Unnecessary fragmentation should be avoided when possible due to the following;
-	Fragmentation is bandwidth inefficient, since the complete IP header is duplicated in each fragment.
-	Fragmentation is CPU intensive since more fragments require more processing at IP endpoints and IP routers. It also requires additional memory at the receiver.
-	If one fragment is lost, the complete IP packet has to be discarded. The reason is there is no selective retransmission of IP fragments provided in IPv4 or IPv6.

DVMRP,Distance-Vector Multicast Routing Protocol,Protocol,V,"NOTE: This section is applicable only to GERAN and UTRAN.
The Packet Domain could allow access to IP Multicast traffic coming from an external network. The support of IP-Multicast in the Packet Domain is optional.
In order for the Packet Core Network to support Multicast traffic that will allow the MS/UE to subscribe to multicast groups from outside the PLMN, the GGSN/P-GW shall support IGMP (IPv4) and/or MLD (IPv6) and one or more Inter-Router Multicast protocols, such as DVMRP, MOSPF, or PIM-SM.
IGMP/MLD is an integral part of IP. All hosts wishing to receive IP multicasts are required to implement IGMP (or equivalent) and class-D IPv4 addresses or MLD and IPv6 multicast according to RFC 2710 [48]. IGMP/MLD messages are encapsulated in IP datagrams.
To be able to deliver IP-Multicast packets to the appropriate Tes, the GGSN/P-GW may have an IP-Multicast proxy functionality.
The IP-Multicast proxy will perform the following tasks:
NOTE:        In this example it is assumed that IGMP/MLD is used as a Host-Router Multicast protocol.
-        maintain a list of mobiles that joined one or more Multicast groups. This list is built/updated each time the GGSN/P-GW receives an IGMP Join or MLD Report message from the mobile;
-        send, based on this maintained list of mobiles, multicast routing information to the routers attached to the Packet Domain, allowing them to route multicast packets;
-        upon reception by the GGSN/P-GW of multicast packets, make and send a copy as Point-to-Point packets, to each mobile of the group.
IP-Multicast traffic can only be handled after an MS/UE has attached to the Packet Domain, and a bearer (e.g. Activated PDP context(s)) (including possibly authentication) pointing to the preferred ISP/external network for this purpose. The Multicast traffic is handled at the application level from a Packet Domain perspective and is sent over UDP/IP.
Figure 12 depicts the protocol configuration for handling Multicast traffic (control plane) for the non-EPC based domain case. The Multicast traffic handling affects the GGSN by the introduction of the IP-Multicast proxy and the support for an Inter-Router Multicast protocol and a host-router multicast protocol. If the protocol configuration for handling Multicast traffic (control plane) is applied for Sgi (i.e EPC based packet domain), the P-GW has the functionality of GGSN and Sgi corresponds to the Gi in Figure 12.

For the procedure described below, it is a prerequisite that the UE is already registered to the 5GC and both SMF and UPF support the L2TP feature. NOTE 1: The scenario where the UE sends actual PPP frames/signalling towards the LAC, which involves back and forth message exchanges between the UE and LAC, for example for LCP Negotiation, is not in the scope of the present document. NOTE 2: The UE does not need to be aware of the L2TP procedure. Figure 4.3.2.4-1: Support of L2TP 1. This step is the same as step 1 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 or step 1 in clause 4.3.2.2.2. The PDU session establishment may include in the PCO information authentication information for PAP and/or CHAP. 2. The SMF may determine that an L2TP session is required for the PDU Session based on local configuration (e.g. related with DNN/S-NSSAI). The SMF may retrieve the L2TP Tunnel parameters from the DN-AAA Server, as described in clause 4.3.2.3, or be configured locally with L2TP Tunnel parameters. The L2TP Tunnel parameters may include information such as the LNS addressing information (e.g. IP address or hostname), as defined in TS 29.561[ 5G System; Interworking between 5G Network and external Data Networks; Stage 3 ]  [63]. 3. This step is the same as step 8 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following additions: If L2TP is required for the PDU Session, the SMF selects a UPF supporting L2TP. 4. This step is the same as step 10a in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following additions: The SMF requests the UPF to setup an L2TP Session towards the L2TP server (LNS). The SMF may send to the UPF as part of N4 signalling, L2TP Tunnel Information and L2TP Session Information to setup a L2TP session. The L2TP Session Information includes specific information related to the PDU Session, e.g. a Calling Number which may be set to UE's SUPI, the Called Number for the L2TP Session which may be configured to contain the DNN, PAP/CHAP related parameters if included by the UE in PCO in step 1 etc. This information is defined in TS 29.561[ 5G System; Interworking between 5G Network and external Data Networks; Stage 3 ]  [63]. 5.

RADIUS,Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service,Protocol,V,"In this case:
-        the MS is given an address belonging to the Intranet/ISP addressing space. The address is given either at subscription in which case it is a static address or at PDP context activation in which case it is a dynamic address. This address is used for packet forwarding within the GGSN and for packet forwarding on the Intranet/ISP. This requires a link between the GGSN and an address allocation server, such as AAA, or DHCP, belonging to the Intranet/ISP;
-        the communication between the Packet Domain and the Intranet/ISP may be performed over any network, even an insecure e.g. the Internet. In case of an insecure connection between the GGSN and the Intranet/ISP there may be a specific security protocol in between. This security protocol is defined by mutual agreement between PLMN operator and Intranet/ISP administrator.
The following description bullet items describe the signal flow.
1)        The TE sends an AT-command to the MT to set up parameters.
2)        The MT sends the Activate PDP context request message to the SGSN which sends the Create PDP context request message to the chosen GGSN.
3)        The GGSN deduces from the APN:
-        the server(s) to be used for address allocation and authentication;
-        the protocol such as RADIUS, DHCP or L2TP to be used with this / those server(s);
-        the communication and security feature needed to dialogue with this / those server(s) e.g. tunnel ,IPSec security association, dial-up connection (using possibly PPP).
As an example the GGSN may use one of the following options:
-        RADIUS for authentication and IP-address allocation. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the GGSN;
-        RADIUS for authentication and DHCP for host configuration and address allocation. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the GGSN. After a successful authentication, the DHCP client discovers the DHCP server(s) in the ISP/Intranet and receives host configuration data;
-        L2TP for forwarding PPP frames to a L2TP Network Server.
4)        The GGSN sends back to the SGSN a Create PDP Context Response message.
5)        Depending on the cause value received in the Create PDP Context Response the SGSN may either send the Activate PDP Context Accept message or send the Activate PDP Context Reject message to the MS.
6)        The MT responds with an AT-response that may indicate whether the context activation was successful or not. In the case of a non-successful context activation the response may also indicate the cause.
In case of a successful context activation, the TE will start its PPP protocol after the LLC link has been established. The LCP, Authentication and NCP negotiations are then carried out. During these negotiations the GGSN may acknowledge values, for any LCP options related to ‘L2’ framing (e.g. ‘ACCM’, ‘ACFC’ and ‘FCS-Alternatives’), as proposed by the MT, which itself is forwarding these negotiations from the TE.
NOTE:        With the <PDP Type>""PPP"" the MT may provide a PPP relay (or proxy) function between the TE and GGSN. This gives the opportunity for the MT to intercept the ‘L2’ framing end to end negotiations.
EXAMPLE:        In the following example the successful PDP context activation is shown.

IPv6,Internet Protocol version 6,Protocol,V,"In the case of interworking with public IP networks (such as the Internet), the PLMN operator shall use public network addresses. These public addresses can be reserved from the responsible IP numbering body, or from an ISP with which the PLMN operator has an agreement. In case of IPv6, a global IPv6 prefix can be obtained from the same sources.
In the case of interworking with private IP networks, two scenarios can be identified:
1.	the PLMN operator manages internally the subnetwork IPv4 addresses and/ or IPv6 prefixes as applicable. Each private network is assigned a unique subnetwork IPv4 addresses and/ or IPv6 prefixes. Normal routing functions are used to route packets to the appropriate private network;
2.	each private network manages its own addressing. In general this will result in different private networks having overlapping address ranges. A logically separate connection (e.g. an IP in IP tunnel or layer 2 virtual circuit) is used between the GGSN/P-GW and each private network. In this case the IP address alone is not necessarily unique. The pair of values, Access Point Name (APN) and IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefixes, is unique.
NOTE 1:	In IPv6, ""site-local addresses""were originally designed to be used for addressing inside of a site that is similar to the usage of ""private addresses"" in IPv4. The usage of ""site-local-addresses"" is deprecated as specified in RFC 4291 [82]. Existing implementations and deployments may continue using site-local addresses. However, in new implementations the prefix that was allocated for ""site local addresses"" shall be treated as for ""global unicast addresses"", see RFC 4291 [82].
The PLMN operator allocates the IP addresses for the subscribers in either of the following ways.
-	The PLMN operator allocates a static IPv4 address and/or a static IPv6 prefix when the subscription record is built. The IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix are respectively reserved from a pool of free IPv4 addresses and/or IPv6 prefixes. Each external network has its own pool of IPv4 addresses and/or IPv6 prefixes.
-	The PLMN operator allocates (either on its own or in conjunction with the external network) a dynamic IPv4 address and/or a dynamic IPv6 prefix as described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3], 3GPP TS 23.401 [77] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [78].

IPv4 based address allocation is considered a transition solution and is deprecated for MTC used over 3GPP accesses.

1)	The DHCPv4 client function in the P-GW sends a DHCPDISCOVER as an IP limited broadcast message, i.e. the destination address 255.255.255.255, towards the external PDN. If the P-GW has the DHCPv4 server IP addresses configured for the APN, the DHCPDISCOVER shall be send as unicast (or even multicast) to the external DHCPv4 servers.
2)	Upon receiving the DHCPDISCOVER request message, the external DHCPv4 servers reply by sending a DHCPOFFER message including an offered IP address. Several DHCPOFFER messages may be received by the P-GW if multiple DHCPv4 servers respond to the DHCPDISCOVER.
3)	The DHCPv4 client function in the P-GW processes the messages and sends a DHCPREQUEST towards the selected external DHCPv4 server.
4)	Upon receiving the DHCPREQUEST message, the selected external DHCPv4 server acknowledges the address allocation by sending a DHCPACK containing the lease period (T1), the time-out time (T2) and the configuration information requested in DHCPREQUEST. The P-GW stores the allocated IPv4 address, the lease timers and the configuration parameters. The IPv4 address and the configuration parameters shall be delivered to the UE through P-GW to UE messages.

DHCPv6,Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6,Protocol,V,"In this case, the P-GW provides the UE with an IPv6 Prefix belonging to the Intranet/ISP addressing space. A dynamic IPv6 address is given using stateless address autoconfiguration. This IPv6 address is used for packet forwarding within the packet domain and for packet forwarding on the Intranet/ISP.
When a P-GW receives an initial access request (e.g. Create Session Request or Proxy Binding Update) message, the P-GW deduces from local configuration data associated with the APN:
-	The source of IPv6 Prefixes (P-GW internal prefix pool, or external address allocation server);
-	Any server(s) to be used for address allocation, authentication and/or protocol configuration options retrieval (e.g. IMS related configuration, see 3GPP TS 24.229 [47]);
-	The protocol, i.e. RADIUS, Diameter or DHCPv6, to be used with the server(s);
-	The communication and security feature needed to communicate with the server(s);
As an example the P-GW may use one of the following options:
-	P-GW internal Prefix pool for IPv6 prefixes allocation and no authentication;
-	P-GW internal Prefix pool for IPv6 prefixes allocation and RADIUS for authentication. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the P-GW;
-	RADIUS for authentication and IPv6 prefix allocation. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the P-GW;

In these figures, F1-U and F1-C are carried over two backhaul hops. F1-U and F1-C use an IP transport layer between IAB-DU and IAB-donor-CU as defined in TS 38.470[ NG-RAN; F1 general aspects and principles ]  [32]. F1-U and F1-C need to be security-protected as described in TS 33.501[ Security architecture and procedures for 5G System ]  [5] (the security layer is not shown in the Figures 4.7.2-1/2). On the wireless backhaul, the IP layer is carried over the Backhaul Adaptation Protocol (BAP) sublayer, which enables routing over multiple hops. The IP layer can also be used for non-F1 traffic, such as OAM traffic as defined in TS 38.401[ NG-RAN; Architecture description ]  [4]. On each backhaul link, the BAP PDUs are carried by BH RLC channels. Multiple BH RLC channels can be configured on each BH link to allow traffic prioritization and QoS enforcement. The BH-RLC-channel mapping for BAP PDUs is performed by the BAP entities on each IAB-node and the IAB-donor-DU.

DHCPv4,Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4,Protocol,V,"The UE may obtain the IPv4 address and/or its configuration parameters at or after the initial access signalling (e.g. default bearer establishment) to the packet domain. The request for IPv4 address and/or configuration parameters from the UE may trigger the P-GW acting as DHCPv4 client to request the IPv4 address and/or configuration parameters from an external DHCPv4 server and deliver them to the UE. See subclause 11.2.1.2.2 for details. The DHCPv4 functions in the P-GW, the UE and the external DHCPv4 server shall be compliant to RFC 2131 [26], RFC 1542 [27] and RFC 4039 [79].
The following bullet items describe the successful IPv4 address allocation and parameter configuration signalling flow between the P-GW and the external DHCPv4 server as depicted Figure 16h. For a detailed description of the DHCPv4 messages, refer to RFC 2131 [26], RFC 1542 [27] and RFC 4039 [79].
Figure 16h is an example signalling flow for IPv4 address allocation and parameter configuration at the default bearer setup using DHCPv4 as specified in RFC 2131 [26]. If the optimized signalling (Rapid Commit Option) is used as per RFC 4039 [79], the messages 2-3 can be eliminated.
1)	The DHCPv4 client function in the P-GW sends a DHCPDISCOVER as an IP limited broadcast message, i.e. the destination address 255.255.255.255, towards the external PDN. If the P-GW has the DHCPv4 server IP addresses configured for the APN, the DHCPDISCOVER shall be send as unicast (or even multicast) to the external DHCPv4 servers.
2)	Upon receiving the DHCPDISCOVER request message, the external DHCPv4 servers reply by sending a DHCPOFFER message including an offered IP address. Several DHCPOFFER messages may be received by the P-GW if multiple DHCPv4 servers respond to the DHCPDISCOVER.
3)	The DHCPv4 client function in the P-GW processes the messages and sends a DHCPREQUEST towards the selected external DHCPv4 server.
4)	Upon receiving the DHCPREQUEST message, the selected external DHCPv4 server acknowledges the address allocation by sending a DHCPACK containing the lease period (T1), the time-out time (T2) and the configuration information requested in DHCPREQUEST. The P-GW stores the allocated IPv4 address, the lease timers and the configuration parameters. The IPv4 address and the configuration parameters shall be delivered to the UE through P-GW to UE messages.

DHCP,Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol,Protocol,V,"The following description bullet items describe the DHCPv4 signal flow. For a detailed description of the DHCP messages refer to RFC 2131 [26] and RFC 1542 [27]. The end-to-end protocol configuration is depicted in figure 16c.
1)	The TE and MT exchange several AT commands carrying the QoS and other parameters requested by the TE, and requesting the activation of a PDP context of PDP type IP. The TE selects the APN of the configured Intranet/ISP offering a DHCP service, or the APN consisting of the Reserved Service Label for DHCP that the user has subscribed to. In the latter case the TE will be connected to a PLMN operator-configured service provider offering a DHCP service (according to the APN selection rules).
2)	The MT sends the Activate PDP Context Request message to the SGSN with an empty PDP address field.
3)	The SGSN selects a GGSN based on the APN requested by the MS and sends a Create PDP Context Request message to that GGSN. The GGSN replies with a Create PDP Context Response message. If the GGSN has not been configured by the operator to use external PDN address allocation with DHCP for the requested APN, the cause shall be set to ‘Service not supported’. No IP address is assigned at this point; the PDP address returned by the GGSN is set to 0.0.0.0, indicating that the IP address is not yet assigned and shall be negotiated by the TE with the Intranet/ISP after the PDP context activation procedure.
4)	Depending on the cause value received in the Create PDP Context Response the SGSN sends either an Activate PDP Context Accept or an Activate PDP Context Reject back to the MT. In case of a successful activation the PDP context is established with the PDP address set to 0.0.0.0.
5)	Upon reception of the Activate PDP Context Accept, the MT sends an AT response to the TE that acknowledges the completion of the PDP context activation procedure.
6)	The TE sends a DHCPDISCOVER message with the IP destination address set to the limited broadcast address (all 1s). The GGSN will pass the DHCPDISCOVER to the DHCP relay agent which will relay the request to the DHCP server configured for the APN of the PDP context. If more than one DHCP server is configured for a given APN, the request will be sent to all of them. The DHCP relay agent will add enough information to the DHCPDISCOVER message to be able to relay the replies back to the MS. How this is done is out of the scope of 3GPP standardisation.
7)	DHCP servers receiving the DHCPDISCOVER request reply by sending a DHCPOFFER message including an offered IP address. The DHCP relay agent forwards the replies to the proper MS.
8)	The TE chooses one of the possibly several DHCPOFFERs and sends a DHCPREQUEST confirming its choice and requesting additional configuration information. The relay agent relays the DHCPOFFER as explained in step 6.
9)	The selected DHCP server receives the DHCPREQUEST and replies with a DHCPACK containing the configuration information requested by the TE. The DHCP relay agent relays the DHCPACK to the TE.
10)	The DHCP relay agent passes the allocated IP address to the GGSN which stores it in the corresponding PDP context. The GGSN then initiates a PDP context modification procedure by sending an Update PDP Context Request to the appropriate SGSN with the End User Address information element set to the allocated IP address.
11)	The SGSN sends a Modify PDP Context Request to the MT with the allocated IP address in the PDP Address information element. The MT acknowledges by sending a Modify PDP Context Accept to the SGSN.
12)	The SGSN sends an Update PDP Context Response to the GGSN. The PDP context has been successfully updated with the allocated IP address.
EXAMPLE:	In the following example a successful PDP context activation with use of DHCP from end to end is shown.

Coordination between 5GMM and EMM is not needed, except as specified in the present subclause, subclause 5.1.5 and 5.3.13A. For dual-registration mode the following applies: a) a UE operating in the dual-registration mode may register to N1 mode only, S1 mode only, or to both N1 mode and S1 mode; b) when the UE decides to operate in dual-registration mode (see subclause 5.5.1.2.4), NAS informs the lower layers about this; c) if a UE is registered in N1 mode only, then for registration in S1 mode the UE shall use: 1) the same PLMN to which it is registered in N1 mode; or 2) an equivalent PLMN; and d) if a UE is registered in S1 mode only, then for registration in N1 mode the UE shall use: 1) the same PLMN to which it is registered in S1 mode; or 2) an equivalent PLMN. NOTE 1: It is up to UE implementation how to handle the case when the UE is registered in both N1 mode and S1 mode and the PLMNs to which the UE is registered, are not equivalent, e.g. search for a PLMN which is the same or equivalent to any of the registered ones. When no PDU session is active and the UE has not registered to S1 mode yet, the UE may initiate the EPS attach procedure with PDN connection establishment if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the MME. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the MME, the UE may initiate either the EPS attach procedure without PDN connection establishment or the attach procedure with PDN connection establishment. When at least one PDU session is active and the UE has not registered to S1 mode yet, the UE may initiate the EPS attach procedure. If necessary, the UE may transfer an active PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode by initiating the EPS attach procedure with request type set to ""handover"" in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message. After successfully attached in S1 mode, if necessary, the UE may transfer other active PDU sessions from N1 mode to S1 mode by initiating the PDN connectivity procedure with request type set to ""handover"" in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

Linked NSAPI is set equal to the NSAPI of the PDP context over which the Join request was received. The IP multicast address is the one requested by the UE in the Join request. The APN may be different from the APN to which the default PDP context has been activated. In any case, the APN may resolve to a GGSN that is different from the GGSN receiving the IGMP/MLD Join request.

NGEN-DC,Non-Geran E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity,Technology,V,"In MR-DC, the UE has a single RRC state, based on the MN RRC and a single C-plane connection towards the Core Network. Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates the Control plane architecture for MR-DC. Each radio node has its own RRC entity (E-UTRA version if the node is an eNB or NR version if the node is a gNB) which can generate RRC PDUs to be sent to the UE. RRC PDUs generated by the SN can be transported via the MN to the UE. The MN always sends the initial SN RRC configuration via MCG SRB (SRB1), but subsequent reconfigurations may be transported via MN or SN. When transporting RRC PDU from the SN, the MN does not modify the UE configuration provided by the SN. In E-UTRA connected to EPC, at initial connection establishment SRB1 uses E-UTRA PDCP. If the UE supports EN-DC, regardless whether EN-DC is configured or not, after initial connection establishment, MCG SRBs (SRB1 and SRB2) can be configured by the network to use either E-UTRA PDCP or NR PDCP (either SRB1 and SRB2 are both configured with E-UTRA PDCP, or they are both configured with NR PDCP). Change from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP (or vice-versa) is supported via a handover procedure (reconfiguration with mobility) or, for the initial change of SRB1 from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP, with a reconfiguration without mobility before the initial security activation. If the SN is a gNB (i.e. for EN-DC, NGEN-DC and NR-DC), the UE can be configured to establish a SRB with the SN (SRB3) to enable RRC PDUs for the SN to be sent directly between the UE and the SN. RRC PDUs for the SN can only be transported directly to the UE for SN RRC reconfiguration not requiring any coordination with the MN. Measurement reporting for mobility within the SN can be done directly from the UE to the SN if SRB3 is configured. In NR-DC, the UE can be configured to establish a SRB with the SN (SRB5) to enable RRC messages which include application layer measurement report information to be sent directly between the UE and the SN.

EN-DC,E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity,Technology,UU,"In MR-DC, the UE has a single RRC state, based on the MN RRC and a single C-plane connection towards the Core Network. Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates the Control plane architecture for MR-DC. Each radio node has its own RRC entity (E-UTRA version if the node is an eNB or NR version if the node is a gNB) which can generate RRC PDUs to be sent to the UE. RRC PDUs generated by the SN can be transported via the MN to the UE. The MN always sends the initial SN RRC configuration via MCG SRB (SRB1), but subsequent reconfigurations may be transported via MN or SN. When transporting RRC PDU from the SN, the MN does not modify the UE configuration provided by the SN. In E-UTRA connected to EPC, at initial connection establishment SRB1 uses E-UTRA PDCP. If the UE supports EN-DC, regardless whether EN-DC is configured or not, after initial connection establishment, MCG SRBs (SRB1 and SRB2) can be configured by the network to use either E-UTRA PDCP or NR PDCP (either SRB1 and SRB2 are both configured with E-UTRA PDCP, or they are both configured with NR PDCP). Change from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP (or vice-versa) is supported via a handover procedure (reconfiguration with mobility) or, for the initial change of SRB1 from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP, with a reconfiguration without mobility before the initial security activation. If the SN is a gNB (i.e. for EN-DC, NGEN-DC and NR-DC), the UE can be configured to establish a SRB with the SN (SRB3) to enable RRC PDUs for the SN to be sent directly between the UE and the SN. RRC PDUs for the SN can only be transported directly to the UE for SN RRC reconfiguration not requiring any coordination with the MN. Measurement reporting for mobility within the SN can be done directly from the UE to the SN if SRB3 is configured. In NR-DC, the UE can be configured to establish a SRB with the SN (SRB5) to enable RRC messages which include application layer measurement report information to be sent directly between the UE and the SN. The application measurement report can be sent directly from the UE to the SN if SRB5 is configured and indicated by the network for the application measurement reporting. Split SRB is supported for all MR-DC options, allowing duplication of RRC PDUs generated by the MN, via the direct path and via the SN. Split SRB uses NR PDCP. This version of the specification does not support the duplication of RRC PDUs generated by the SN via the MN and SN paths. In EN-DC, the SCG configuration is kept in the UE during suspension. During connection resumption, if the UE supports resuming with EN-DC, the UE can be configured to release, restore, or reconfigure the SCG configuration. Otherwise, the UE releases the SCG configuration (but not the radio bearer configuration) during resumption initiation. In MR-DC with 5GC, the UE stores the PDCP/SDAP configuration and the SCG configuration when moving to RRC Inactive. During connection resumption, if the UE supports resuming with MR-DC, the UE can be configured to release, restore, or reconfigure the SCG configuration. Otherwise, it releases the SCG configuration.

GSM,Global System for Mobile Communications,Technology,U,"The security parameters for authentication and ciphering are tied together in sets. In a GSM authentication challenge, from a challenge parameter RAND both the authentication response parameter SRES and the GSM ciphering key can be computed given the secret key associated to the IMSI. In a UMTS authentication challenge, from a challenge parameter RAND, the authentication response parameter RES and the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key can be computed given the secret key associated to the IMSI. In addition, in the USIM a GSM ciphering key can be computed from the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key by means of an unkeyed conversion function. Furthermore, in A/Gb mode if an A5 ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is taken into use, then a GSM Kc128 shall also be calculated as described in the subclause 4.3.2.3a. In order to allow start of ciphering on a RR connection without authentication, the ciphering key sequence numbers are introduced. The ciphering key sequence number is managed by the network in the way that the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message contains the ciphering key sequence number allocated to the GSM ciphering key (in case of a GSM authentication challenge) or the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key (in case of a UMTS authentication challenge) which may be computed from the RAND parameter carried in that message. If an authentication procedure has been completed successfully and a ciphering key sequence number is stored in the network, the network shall include a different ciphering key sequence number in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message when it intiates a new authentication procedure. The mobile station stores the ciphering key sequence number with the GSM ciphering key (in case of a GSM authentication challenge) and the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key (in case of a UMTS authentication challenge) and indicates to the network in the first message (LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, CM SERVICE REQUEST, PAGING RESPONSE, CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST) which ciphering key sequence number the stored GSM ciphering key (in case of a GSM authentication challenge) or set of UMTS ciphering, UMTS integrity, derived GSM ciphering key, and potentially the derived GSM Kc128 (in case of a UMTS authentication challenge) has. When the deletion of the ciphering key sequence number is described this also means that the associated GSM ciphering key, the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key shall be considered as invalid and also the GSM Kc128 shall be deleted if any (i.e. the established GSM security context or the UMTS security context is no longer valid). In A/Gb mode, the network may choose to start ciphering with the stored GSM ciphering key or GSM Kc128 (under the restrictions given in 3GPP TS 42.009[ Security aspects ]  [5]) if the stored ciphering key sequence number and the one given from the mobile station are equal. NOTE 1: The decision of starting ciphering with the GSM ciphering key or the GSM Kc128 depends on whether the network indicates in the CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message an A5 ciphering algorithm which requires a 64 or 128-bit ciphering key as specified in 3GPP TS 33.102[ 3G security; Security architecture ]  [5a].

SRES,Signed Response,Parameter,V,"The security parameters for authentication and ciphering are tied together in sets. In a GSM authentication challenge, from a challenge parameter RAND both the authentication response parameter SRES and the GSM ciphering key can be computed given the secret key associated to the IMSI. In a UMTS authentication challenge, from a challenge parameter RAND, the authentication response parameter RES and the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key can be computed given the secret key associated to the IMSI. In addition, in the USIM a GSM ciphering key can be computed from the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key by means of an unkeyed conversion function. Furthermore, in A/Gb mode if an A5 ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is taken into use, then a GSM Kc128 shall also be calculated as described in the subclause 4.3.2.3a. In order to allow start of ciphering on a RR connection without authentication, the ciphering key sequence numbers are introduced.

The EPS bearer context modification procedure is initiated by the network, but it may also be initiated as part of the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure.
The network may also initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure to update the APN-AMBR of the UE, for instance after an inter-system handover. See 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] annex E.
The MME may also initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure to update the WLAN offload indication to the UE, for instance after the MME received an updated WLAN offload indication of a PDN Connection from HSS. See 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] clause 4.3.23.
The MME may also initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure to update information required for inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode (e.g. session-AMBR, QoS rule(s)). See 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

MTU,Maximum Transmission Unit,Parameter,V,"Upon receipt of a request to transfer user data via the control plane, if the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE initiates the procedure by sending the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message including the user data to be sent in the User data container IE (see example in figure 6.6.4.2.1). The length of the value part of the User data container IE should not exceed the link MTU size for the respective type of user data (IPv4, IPv6 or Non-IP). If the user data in the value part of the User data container IE is an Ethernet frame, then the length of the Ethernet frame payload should not exceed the Ethernet frame payload MTU size.
NOTE:	The recommended maximum size for link MTU is 1358 octets to prevent fragmentation in the backbone network (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]). Depending on the network configuration, setting link MTU size to a value larger than 1358 octets could lead to inefficient core network implementation due to fragmentation.
If the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode, the UE initiates the procedure by sending the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message included in a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.
Based on information provided by the upper layers, the UE may include a Release assistance indication IE in the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message to inform the network that
1)	subsequent to the current uplink data transmission no further uplink or downlink data transmission (e.g. an acknowledgement or response) is expected; i.e. the upper layers indicated that data exchanges have completed with the current UL data transfer; or
2)	subsequent to the current uplink data transmission only a single downlink data transmission and no further uplink data transmission is expected; i.e. the upper layers indicated that data exchanges will have completed with the next downlink data transmission.
When receiving the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message, the MME shall identify the PDN connection to the SCEF or to the PDN GW, based on the EPS bearer identity included in message, and forward the contents of the User data container IE accordingly. If the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message includes a Release assistance indication IE, then ESM layer indicates to the EMM layer to initiate release of the NAS signalling connection,
1)	if the release assistance indication indicates that no further uplink and no further downlink data transmission subsequent to the uplink data transmission is expected; or
2)	upon subsequent delivery of the next received downlink data transmission to the UE if the release assistance indication indicates that only a single downlink data transmission and no further uplink data transmission subsequent to the uplink data transmission is expected.

When a GGSN receives a Create PDP Context Request message for a given APN, the GGSN shall immediately send a Create PDP context response back to the SGSN. After PPP link setup, the authentication phase may take place. During Authentication phase, the GGSN sends a Diameter AA-Request to a Diameter server. The Diameter server authenticates and authorizes the user. If Diameter is also responsible for IP address allocation the Diameter server shall return the allocated IP address or IPv6 prefix in the AA-answer message (if the user was authenticated).
If the user is not authenticated, the GGSN shall send a Delete PDP context request to the SGSN. The AA-Request and AA-Answer messages are only used for the primary PDP context.
Even if the GGSN was not involved in user authentication (e.g. for PPP no authentication may be selected), it may send a Diameter Accounting-Request (START) message to a Diameter server. If no Diameter session is already open for the user a Diameter session needs to be activated, otherwise the existing Diameter session is used to send the Accounting-Request (START). The NSAPI will identify the particular PDP context this accounting refers to. The Accounting-Request message also indicates to the Diameter server that the user session has started, and the QoS parameters associated to the session. This message contains parameters, e.g. a tuple which includes the user-id, IP address or IPv6 prefix, and the MSISDN to be used by application servers (e.g. WAP gateway) in order to identify the user.
If some external applications require Diameter Accounting request (Start) information before they can process user packets, then the selected APN (GGSN) may be configured in such a way that the GGSN drops user data until the Accounting Answer (START) is received from the Diameter server. The GGSN may delete the PDP context if the Accounting Answer (START) is not received. The Authentication and Accounting servers may be separately configured for each APN.
When the GGSN receives a Delete PDP Context Request message and providing a Diameter Accounting-Request (START) message was sent previously, the GGSN shall send a Diameter Accounting-Request (STOP) message to the Diameter server, which indicates the termination of this particular user session. The NSAPI will identify the particular PDP context this accounting refers to. The GGSN shall immediately send a Delete PDP context response, without waiting for an Accounting-Answer (STOP) message from the Diameter server.
If this was the last PDP context for that PDP address, the GGSN shall additionally send an STR message to the Diameter server.

However some IP applications could need to interwork with the P-GW to release the corresponding resource (e.g. terminate a particular bearer or Resource Allocation Deactivation procedures as defined in TS 23.402 [78]). For this purpose, the Diameter server or proxy may send a Diameter ASR along with the EPS bearer ID, if available, to identify the particular bearer to be terminated to the P-GW. The P-GW should react by deleting the corresponding bearer. If the P-GW deletes the corresponding bearer, it need not wait for the response from the S-GW or trusted non-3GPP IP access or ePDG before sending the ASA to the server.
The absence of the EPS bearer ID in the Diameter ASR message indicates to the P-GW that all bearers/resources for this particular user and sharing the same user session shall be deleted. The bearer(s)/resources belonging to the same IP-CAN session are identified by the Diameter Session-Id. If a user has the same user IP address(es) for different sets of bearers towards different networks, only the bearers linked to the one identified by the Diameter Session-Id shall be deleted.

Figure 5.6.2.3.1.1: Paging procedure for CS fallback to A/Gb or Iu mode
To initiate the procedure when no NAS signalling connection exists and no paging restriction applied in the network for that paging, the EMM entity in the network requests the lower layer to start paging (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [20], 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]).

3GPP TS 23.401,3GPP Technical Specification 23.401,Specification,V,"In the case of interworking with public IP networks (such as the Internet), the PLMN operator shall use public network addresses. These public addresses can be reserved from the responsible IP numbering body, or from an ISP with which the PLMN operator has an agreement. In case of IPv6, a global IPv6 prefix can be obtained from the same sources.
In the case of interworking with private IP networks, two scenarios can be identified:
1.	the PLMN operator manages internally the subnetwork IPv4 addresses and/ or IPv6 prefixes as applicable. Each private network is assigned a unique subnetwork IPv4 addresses and/ or IPv6 prefixes. Normal routing functions are used to route packets to the appropriate private network;
2.	each private network manages its own addressing. In general this will result in different private networks having overlapping address ranges. A logically separate connection (e.g. an IP in IP tunnel or layer 2 virtual circuit) is used between the GGSN/P-GW and each private network. In this case the IP address alone is not necessarily unique. The pair of values, Access Point Name (APN) and IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefixes, is unique.
NOTE 1:	In IPv6, ""site-local addresses""were originally designed to be used for addressing inside of a site that is similar to the usage of ""private addresses"" in IPv4. The usage of ""site-local-addresses"" is deprecated as specified in RFC 4291 [82]. Existing implementations and deployments may continue using site-local addresses. However, in new implementations the prefix that was allocated for ""site local addresses"" shall be treated as for ""global unicast addresses"", see RFC 4291 [82].
The PLMN operator allocates the IP addresses for the subscribers in either of the following ways.
-	The PLMN operator allocates a static IPv4 address and/or a static IPv6 prefix when the subscription record is built. The IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix are respectively reserved from a pool of free IPv4 addresses and/or IPv6 prefixes. Each external network has its own pool of IPv4 addresses and/or IPv6 prefixes.
-	The PLMN operator allocates (either on its own or in conjunction with the external network) a dynamic IPv4 address and/or a dynamic IPv6 prefix as described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3], 3GPP TS 23.401 [77] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [78].

IPv4 based address allocation is considered a transition solution and is deprecated for MTC used over 3GPP accesses.

Additionally, the MS shall: - if the MS maintains a counter for ""SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services"" events and the counter has a value less than an MS implementation-specific maximum value, proceed as specified in subclause 4.1.1.6A, list item 1.a) for the case a LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message is received without integrity protection.

CSI-RS,Channel State Information-Reference Signal,Channel,V,"Load balancing is achieved in NR with handover, redirection mechanisms upon RRC release and through the usage of inter-frequency and inter-RAT absolute priorities and inter-frequency Qoffset parameters. Measurements to be performed by a UE for connected mode mobility are classified in at least four measurement types: - Intra-frequency NR measurements; - Inter-frequency NR measurements; - Inter-RAT measurements for E-UTRA; - Inter-RAT measurements for UTRA. For each measurement type one or several measurement objects can be defined (a measurement object defines e.g. the carrier frequency to be monitored). For each measurement object one or several reporting configurations can be defined (a reporting configuration defines the reporting criteria). Three reporting criteria are used: event triggered reporting, periodic reporting and event triggered periodic reporting. The association between a measurement object and a reporting configuration is created by a measurement identity (a measurement identity links together one measurement object and one reporting configuration of the same RAT). By using several measurement identities (one for each measurement object, reporting configuration pair) it is then possible to: - Associate several reporting configurations to one measurement object and; - Associate one reporting configuration to several measurement objects. The measurements identity is used as well when reporting results of the measurements. Measurement quantities are considered separately for each RAT. Measurement commands are used by NG-RAN to order the UE to start, modify or stop measurements. Handover can be performed within the same RAT and/or CN, or it can involve a change of the RAT and/or CN. Inter system fallback towards E-UTRAN is performed when 5GC does not support emergency services, voice services, for load balancing etc. Depending on factors such as CN interface availability, network configuration and radio conditions, the fallback procedure results in either RRC_CONNECTED state mobility (handover procedure) or RRC_IDLE state mobility (redirection), see TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3] and TS 38.331[ NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification ]  [12].

SRB,Signaling Radio Bearer,Channel,V,"In MR-DC, the UE has a single RRC state, based on the MN RRC and a single C-plane connection towards the Core Network. Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates the Control plane architecture for MR-DC. Each radio node has its own RRC entity (E-UTRA version if the node is an eNB or NR version if the node is a gNB) which can generate RRC PDUs to be sent to the UE. RRC PDUs generated by the SN can be transported via the MN to the UE. The MN always sends the initial SN RRC configuration via MCG SRB (SRB1), but subsequent reconfigurations may be transported via MN or SN. When transporting RRC PDU from the SN, the MN does not modify the UE configuration provided by the SN. In E-UTRA connected to EPC, at initial connection establishment SRB1 uses E-UTRA PDCP. If the UE supports EN-DC, regardless whether EN-DC is configured or not, after initial connection establishment, MCG SRBs (SRB1 and SRB2) can be configured by the network to use either E-UTRA PDCP or NR PDCP (either SRB1 and SRB2 are both configured with E-UTRA PDCP, or they are both configured with NR PDCP). Change from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP (or vice-versa) is supported via a handover procedure (reconfiguration with mobility) or, for the initial change of SRB1 from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP, with a reconfiguration without mobility before the initial security activation. If the SN is a gNB (i.e. for EN-DC, NGEN-DC and NR-DC), the UE can be configured to establish a SRB with the SN (SRB3) to enable RRC PDUs for the SN to be sent directly between the UE and the SN. RRC PDUs for the SN can only be transported directly to the UE for SN RRC reconfiguration not requiring any coordination with the MN. Measurement reporting for mobility within the SN can be done directly from the UE to the SN if SRB3 is configured. In NR-DC, the UE can be configured to establish a SRB with the SN (SRB5) to enable RRC messages which include application layer measurement report information to be sent directly between the UE and the SN. The application measurement report can be sent directly from the UE to the SN if SRB5 is configured and indicated by the network for the application measurement reporting. Split SRB is supported for all MR-DC options, allowing duplication of RRC PDUs generated by the MN, via the direct path and via the SN. Split SRB uses NR PDCP. This version of the specification does not support the duplication of RRC PDUs generated by the SN via the MN and SN paths. In EN-DC, the SCG configuration is kept in the UE during suspension. During connection resumption, if the UE supports resuming with EN-DC, the UE can be configured to release, restore, or reconfigure the SCG configuration. Otherwise, the UE releases the SCG configuration (but not the radio bearer configuration) during resumption initiation. In MR-DC with 5GC, the UE stores the PDCP/SDAP configuration and the SCG configuration when moving to RRC Inactive. During connection resumption, if the UE supports resuming with MR-DC, the UE can be configured to release, restore, or reconfigure the SCG configuration. Otherwise, it releases the SCG configuration.

N4,Interface between SMF and UPF,Interface,V,"This procedure is used in the case of home-routed roaming scenarios. Figure 4.3.4.3-1: UE or network requested PDU Session Release for home-routed roaming 1. The procedure is triggered by one of the following events: 1a. (UE initiated release) As in step 1a of clause 4.3.4.2 with the addition that: - the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and - the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (SM Context ID, information from the SM message from the UE e.g. PCO, ""Trigger PDU Session Release"" indication, Timezone, User Location Information) service operation to request the H-SMF to release the PDU Session. The H-SMF responds to the request immediately. 1b. (Serving network initiated release) The serving network initiates the PDU Session Release during UE or serving network initiated Deregistration procedure as specified in clause 4.2.2.3. There is no NAS SM message between the UE and the V-SMF in this case. This step is the same as step 1c in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and - the V-SMF initiates the release of the PDU Session at the H-SMF by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_Release request. The serving network also initiates the PDU Session Release where neither N1 nor N2 SM signalling is needed before releasing the SM context as in step 1c in clause 4.3.4.2 if e.g. due to the set of network slices for a UE changes where a network slice instance is no longer available (e.g. as described in clause 5.15.5.2.2 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2], or the AAA Server triggered Network Slice-Specific Re-authentication and Re-authorization procedure fails as specified in clause 4.2.9.2 or the AAA Server triggered Slice-Specific Authorization Revocation takes place as specified in clause 4.2.9.4). 1c. (HPLMN initiated release) This step is the same as step 1b in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - the H-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the H-UPF to stop forwarding downlink traffic. 1d. This step is the same as step 1d in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and - the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request towards H-SMF. 1e. (HPLMN initiated release) This step is the same as step 1e in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - if the H-SMF is notified by the V-SMF that the HPLMN S-NSSAI of the PDU Session with SSC mode 1 or SSC mode 2 is to be replaced with Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and if the H-SMF determines that a new PDU Session is to be established on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI, the H-SMF initiates release of the PDU Session, as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2]; - the H-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the H-UPF to stop forwarding downlink traffic. 1f. This step is the same as step 1f in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and - the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request towards H-SMF. If the SMF receives one of the triggers in step 1a, 1c, 1e or 1f, the H-SMF starts PDU Session Release procedure. When a SMF above initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the UPF to stop forwarding traffic this means also to stop taking into account the traffic for usage monitoring. 2a-2b. (UE-, (R)AN- or Serving network initiated) This step is performed in case the PDU Session Release is triggered by a message from V-SMF. These steps are the same as steps 2a-2b in clause 4.3.4.2. The SMF is the SMF in HPLMN. NOTE 1: This step 2a-2b can correspond to steps 1a, 1b, 1d, 1f. 3a. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The H-SMF prepares the SM Release PDU Session Command message and initiates the PDU Session Release towards the UE by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request service operation towards the V-SMF. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request contains necessary information to build the SM Release PDU Session Command by the V-SMF towards the UE (for example a Release Cause or PCO). For network slice replacement as in step 1e, the H-SMF includes Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and a cause value indicating that a new PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI is required. 3b. (Serving network initiated release) The H-SMF responds to the PDU release request from the V-SMF with a Nsmf_PDUSession_Release response. If the UPF included Small Data Rate Control Status in step 2 then the SMF includes Small Data Rate Control Status in the request to the AMF. If the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU Session, the steps 4a and 4b are skipped. 4a-4b. The V-SMF releases the corresponding User Plane resources. This includes the same procedure in step 2 but controlled from the SMF in VPLMN. 5-13. These steps are the same as steps 3-10 in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - In step 5c, for network slice replacement, based on information from H-SMF, the PDU Session Release Command message may include Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and/or Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI and a cause value indicating that a PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and/or Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI is required. 14. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The V-SMF responds to the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request invoked at step 3a and confirms the PDU Session Release. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Update response may carry information such as PCO received from the UE in SM PDU Session Release Accept. as well as User Location Information, Time Zone and Secondary RAT Usage Data. 15a. (UE or HPLMN or Serving network initiated release) The H-SMF releases the SM policy control association with the PCF by invoking the SM Policy Association Termination procedure defined in clause 4.16.6. For serving network initiated PDU Session Release case, this step happens between step 1b and step 3b. 15b-15c. (HPLMN initiated release) In case the PDU Session Release is HPLMN-initiated (i.e. triggers in 1c, 1e), the H-SMF releases the corresponding User Plane resources. This includes the same procedure as in step 2. 15d. As in step 15 of clause 4.3.4.2, the SMF invokes the Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service operation. NOTE 2: Step 15d does not necessarily take place after step 15c. 16. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The H-SMF shall remove all contexts associated with the PDU Session: 16a. The H-SMF requests the V-SMF to release all contexts associated with the PDU Session by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify (Release) operation. 16b. The V-SMF requests the AMF to release all contexts associated with the PDU Session by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify (Release). The AMF releases the association between the SMF ID and the PDU Session ID.",UE or network requested PDU Session Release for Home-routed Roaming,"This procedure is used in home-routed roaming scenarios.

Sgi,Service Gateway Interface,Interface,V,"In this case, the P-GW provides the UE with an IPv6 Prefix belonging to the Intranet/ISP addressing space. A dynamic IPv6 address is given using stateless address autoconfiguration. This IPv6 address is used for packet forwarding within the packet domain and for packet forwarding on the Intranet/ISP.
When a P-GW receives an initial access request (e.g. Create Session Request or Proxy Binding Update) message, the P-GW deduces from local configuration data associated with the APN:
-	The source of IPv6 Prefixes (P-GW internal prefix pool, or external address allocation server);
-	Any server(s) to be used for address allocation, authentication and/or protocol configuration options retrieval (e.g. IMS related configuration, see 3GPP TS 24.229 [47]);
-	The protocol, i.e. RADIUS, Diameter or DHCPv6, to be used with the server(s);
-	The communication and security feature needed to communicate with the server(s);
As an example the P-GW may use one of the following options:
-	P-GW internal Prefix pool for IPv6 prefixes allocation and no authentication;
-	P-GW internal Prefix pool for IPv6 prefixes allocation and RADIUS for authentication. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the P-GW;
-	RADIUS for authentication and IPv6 prefix allocation. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the P-GW;
The P-GW includes the PDP Address IE in the the initial access response (e.g. Create Session Response or Proxy Binding Acknowledgement) and return an IPv6 address composed of a Prefix and an Interface-Identifier. The Interface-Identifier may have any value and it does not need to be unique within or across APNs. It shall however not conflict with the Interface-Identifier that the P-GW has selected for its own side of the UE-P-GW link. The Prefix assigned by the P-GW or the external AAA server shall be globally or site-local unique (see the Note in subclause 11.3 of this document regarding the usage of site-local addresses).

When the MS receives a subsequent AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, if the stored RAND value for the CS domain is equal to the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, then the mobile station shall not pass the RAND to the USIM, but shall immediately send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message with the stored RES for the CS domain. If, for the CS domain, there is no valid stored RAND in the mobile station or the stored RAND is different from the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the mobile station shall pass the RAND to the USIM, shall override any previously stored RAND and RES with the new ones and start, or reset and restart timer T3218. The RAND and RES values stored in the mobile station shall be deleted and timer T3218, if running, shall be stopped: - upon receipt of a SECURITY MODE COMMAND (Iu mode only), CIPHERING MODE COMMAND (A/Gb mode only), CM_SERVICE_ACCEPT, CM_SERVICE_REJECT, LOCATION_UPDATING_ACCEPT or AUTHENTICATION REJECT message; - upon expiry of timer T3218; or - if the mobile station enters the MM state MM IDLE or NULL.","The N1 interface is a key interface in 5G networks, facilitating communication between the UE and the AMF.",Categorized as an Interface since it defines communication between the UE and network functions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TS.23.008

N1,N1 Interface,Interface,V,"The need for fields to be present in a message or an abstract type, i.e., the ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract notation (ASN.1), is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the OPTIONAL statement in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are available for use in the downlink direction for RRC message and in the sidelink for PC5 RRC message. The meaning of each tag is specified in table 6.1.2-1. If conditions are used, a conditional presence table is provided for the message or information element specifying the need of the field for each condition case. The table also specifies whether UE maintains or releases the value in case the field is absent. The conditions clarify what the UE may expect regarding the setting of the message by the network for the RRC message or by the peer UE in the sidelink RRC message. Violation of conditions is regarded as invalid network behaviour when transmitting downlink RRC message or invalid UE behavior when transmitting PC5 RRC message, which the UE is not required to cope with. Hence the general error handling defined in 10.4 does not apply in case a field is absent although it is mandatory according to the CondC or CondM condition. For guidelines on the use of need codes and conditions, see Annex A.6 and A.7. Table 6.1.2-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for fields to be present NOTE: In this version of the specification, the condition tags CondC and CondM are not used. Any field with Need M or Need N in system information shall be interpreted as Need R. The need code used within a CondX definition only applies for the case (part of the condition) where it is defined: A condition may have different need codes for different parts of the condition. In particular, the CondX definition may contain the following ""otherwise the field is absent"" parts: - ""Otherwise, the field is absent"": The field is not relevant or should not be configured when this part of the condition applies. In particular, the UE behaviour is not defined when the field is configured via another part of the condition and is reconfigured to this part of the condition. A need code is not provided when the transition from another part of the condition to this part of the condition is not supported, when the field clearly is a one-shot or there is no difference whether UE maintains or releases the value (e.g., in case the field is mandatory present according to the other part of the condition). - ""Otherwise, the field is absent, Need R"": The field is released if absent when this part of the condition applies. This handles UE behaviour in case the field is configured via another part of the condition and this part of the condition applies (which means that network when transmitting downlink RRC message or peer UE transmitting PC5 RRC message can assume UE releases the field if this part of the condition is valid). - ""Otherwise, the field is absent, Need M"": The UE retains the field if it was already configured when this part of the condition applies. This means the network when transmitting downlink RRC message or the peer UE when transmitting PC5 RRC message cannot release the field, but UE retains the previously configured value. Use of different Need codes in different parts of a condition should be avoided. For downlink RRC message and sidelink PC5 RRC messages, the need codes, conditions and ASN.1 defaults specified for a particular (child) field only apply in case the (parent) field including the particular field is present. Thus, if the parent is absent the UE shall not release the field unless the absence of the parent field implies that. For (parent) fields without need codes in downlink RRC messages or sidelink PC5 RRC message, if the parent field is absent, UE shall follow the need codes of the child fields. Thus, if parent field is absent, the need code of each child field is followed (i.e. Need R child fields are released, Need M child fields are not modified and the actions for Need S child fields depend on the specified conditions of each field). Examples of (parent) fields in downlink RRC messages and sidelink PC5 RRC message without need codes where this rule applies are: - nonCriticalExtension fields at the end of a message using empty SEQUENCE extension mechanism, - groups of non-critical extensions using double brackets (referred to as extension groups), and - non-critical extensions at the end of a message or at the end of a structure, contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING (referred to as parent extension fields). The handling of need codes as specified in the previous is illustrated by means of an example, as shown in the following ASN.1. -- /example/ ASN1START RRCMessage-IEs ::= SEQUENCE { field1 InformationElement1 OPTIONAL, -- Need M field2 InformationElement2 OPTIONAL, -- Need R nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v1570-IEs OPTIONAL } RRCMessage-1570-IEs ::= SEQUENCE { field3 InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, -- Need M nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v1640-IEs OPTIONAL } RRCMessage-v1640-IEs ::= SEQUENCE { field4 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, -- Need R nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL } InformationElement1 ::= SEQUENCE { field10 InformationElement10 OPTIONAL, -- Need N field11 InformationElement11 OPTIONAL, -- Need M field12 InformationElement12 OPTIONAL, -- Need R ..., [[ field13 InformationElement13 OPTIONAL, -- Need R field14 InformationElement14 OPTIONAL -- Need M ]] } InformationElement2 ::= SEQUENCE { field21 InformationElement11 OPTIONAL, -- Need M ... } -- ASN1STOP The handling of need codes as specified in the previous implies that: - if field1 in RRCMessage-IEs is absent, UE does not modify or take action on any child fields configured within field1 (regardless of their need codes); - if field2 in RRCMessage-IEs is absent, UE releases the field2 (and also its child field field21); - if field1 or field2 in RRCMessage-IEs is present, UE retains or releases their child fields according to the child field presence conditions; - if field1 in RRCMessage-IEs is present but the extension group containing field13 and field14 is absent, the UE releases field13 but does not modify field14; - if nonCriticalExtension defined by IE RRCMessage-v1570-IEs is absent, the UE does not modify field3 but releases field4;",A need code indicating that a field is mandatory and shall be included in the message.,It is classified as a Code because it represents a specific instruction or indicator used in telecommunications messages.,3GPP TS 38.331,6.1.2 Need codes and conditions for optional fields,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gi,GPRS Interworking,Interface,V,"Figure 9: Example of the PDN Interworking Model, transparent case
In figure 9, an example PDN interworking model for transparent access to the Internet is provided for a GGSN and its Gi reference point.
In transparent access to the Internet case:
-	the MS is given an IPv4 address and/or an IPv6 prefix belonging to the operator addressing space. The IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix is assigned either at subscription in which case it is a static address or at IP-CAN session establishment in which case it is a dynamic address. This IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix if applicable is used for packet forwarding between the Internet and the GGSN/P-GW and within the packet domain. With IPv6, Stateless Address Autoconfiguration shall be used to assign an IPv6 address to the MS. These procedures are as described in the IPv6 non-transparent access case except that the addresses belong to the operator addressing space.
-	the MS need not send any authentication request at IP-CAN session establishment procedure and the GGSN/P-GW need not take any part in the user authentication/authorization process.
The transparent case provides at least a basic ISP service. As a consequence of this it may therefore provide a bearer service for a tunnel to a private Intranet.
Note that the remainder of this subclause deals with this specific use-case as depicted in figure 10.
-	The user level configuration may be carried out between the TE and the intranet, the Packet Domain network is transparent to this procedure.
The used protocol stack is depicted in figure 10.
Figure 10: Transparent access to an Intranet
In figure 10, an example for transparent access to an Intranet is provided for a GGSN and its Gi reference point, but the same principle is applicable to EPC.
The communication between the PLMN and the Intranet may be performed over any network, even an insecure network e.g. the Internet. There is no specific security protocol between the GGSN and the Intranet because security is ensured on an end to end basis between the MS and the intranet by the ""Intranet Protocol"".
User authentication and encryption of user data are done within the ""Intranet Protocol"" if either of them is needed. This ""Intranet Protocol"" may also carry private (IP) addresses belonging to the address space of the Intranet.
An example of an ""Intranet Protocol"" is Ipsec (see RFC 1825 [61]). If Ipsec is used for this purpose then Ipsec authentication header or security header may be used for user (data) authentication and for the confidentiality of user data (see RFC 1826 [62] and RFC 1827 [63]).

Gi/SGi,Gateway Interface / Service Gateway Interface,Interface,V,"Gi/SGi PtP tunnelling based on UDP/IP may be used to deliver Non-IP data to an AS via Gi/SGi.
The PtP tunnel is set up by configuration of tunnel parameters in both end of the tunnel.
The following parameters are pre-configured in the GGSN/P-GW per APN;
-	the UDP destination port number to use when sending Non-IP data;
-	the UDP port number it wants to receive Non-IP data;
-	the destination IP address to be used for sending Non-IP data.
NOTE 1:	Many APNs can resolve to the same P-GW, but each APN can be unique to a particular AS.
The following is pre-configured in the AS;
-	the UDP destination port number to use when sending Non-IP data;
-	the UDP port number it wants to receive Non-IP data.
NOTE 2:	The GGSN/P-GW as well as the AS can use any UDP port numbers not assigned by IANA. The port numbers used need to be aligned between peers.
IP address allocation procedures for the UE (i.e. PDN connection) are performed by the GGSN/P-GW as described in subclause 11.2.2. 
The UE IP address for the PDN connection or IPv6 prefix allocated for the PDN connection+suffix assigned for the PtP tunnel end point in the GGSN/P-GW is used as source address in the GGSN/P-GW and as destination address in the AS for the PtP tunnel.
During the PDP context/PDN connection establishment, the GGSN/P-GW associates the GTP-U tunnel for the PDP context/PDN connection with the Gi/SGi PtP tunnel. The GTP-U tunnel with PDP/PDN type “Non-IP” is used.
The GGSN/P-GW acts as a transparent forwarding node between the UE used for CIoT and the AS.
NOTE 3:	The UE can include application level identity to AS, what kind of identity is out of scope of this specification.
For uplink delivery, if the uplink data is received from the GTP-U tunnel the GGSN/P-GW shall forward the received data to the AS over the Gi/SGi PtP tunnel associated with the GTP-U tunnel using UDP/IP encapsulation with the destination address of the AS and the configured UDP destination port number for “Non-IP” data as described above.
For downlink delivery, the AS shall send the data using UDP/IP encapsulation with the IP address or IPv6 prefix+suffix of the UE as destination address and the configured UDP destination port number for “Non-IP” data as described above.
NOTE 3:	The UDP source port number to use for both uplink and downlink Non-IP data transfer can be a pre-configured or a locally allocated port number in the GGSN/P-GW and AS respectively.
NOTE 4:	For downlink delivery, the GGSN/P-GW decapsulates the received data (i.e. removes the UDP/IP headers) and forwards the data to SGSN/S-GW on the GTP-U tunnel identified by the IP address or the IPv6 prefix of the UE (i.e. PDN connection) for delivery to the UE.

Um,Reference Point Um,Interface,V,"This clause describes the procedures used for mobility management for non-GPRS services and for GPRS-services at the radio interface (Reference Point Um and Uu). The main function of the Mobility Management sublayer is to support the mobility of user terminals, such as informing the network of its present location and providing user identity confidentiality. A further function of the MM sublayer is to provide connection management services to the different entities of the upper Connection Management (CM) sublayer (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]). There are two sets of procedures defined in this chapter: - MM procedures for non-GPRS services (performed by the MM entity of the MM sublayer); and - GMM procedures for GPRS services (performed by the GMM entity of the MM sublayer), see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]. All the MM procedures described in this clause can only be performed if a RR connection has been established between the MS and the network. Else, the MM sublayer has to initiate the establishment of a RR connection (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 3.3 and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]). In A/Gb mode, the GMM procedures described in this clause, use services provided by the RR sublayer without prior RR connection establishment. In Iu mode: all the GMM procedures described in this clause can only be performed if a PS signalling connection has been established between the MS and the network. Else, the GMM sublayer has to initiate the establishment of a PS signalling connection (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]). GMM procedures are mandatory and applicable only for GPRS MSs and networks supporting those MSs. For GPRS MSs which are IMSI attached for both GPRS and non-GPRS services, some MM procedures are replaced by GMM combined procedures provided that the network operates in network operation mode I, i.e. is supporting combined GMM procedures.

V-SMF,Visited-Session Management Function,Procedure,V,"This procedure is used in the case of home-routed roaming scenarios. Figure 4.3.4.3-1: UE or network requested PDU Session Release for home-routed roaming 1. The procedure is triggered by one of the following events: 1a. (UE initiated release) As in step 1a of clause 4.3.4.2 with the addition that: - the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and - the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (SM Context ID, information from the SM message from the UE e.g. PCO, ""Trigger PDU Session Release"" indication, Timezone, User Location Information) service operation to request the H-SMF to release the PDU Session. The H-SMF responds to the request immediately. 1b. (Serving network initiated release) The serving network initiates the PDU Session Release during UE or serving network initiated Deregistration procedure as specified in clause 4.2.2.3. There is no NAS SM message between the UE and the V-SMF in this case. This step is the same as step 1c in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and - the V-SMF initiates the release of the PDU Session at the H-SMF by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_Release request. The serving network also initiates the PDU Session Release where neither N1 nor N2 SM signalling is needed before releasing the SM context as in step 1c in clause 4.3.4.2 if e.g. due to the set of network slices for a UE changes where a network slice instance is no longer available (e.g. as described in clause 5.15.5.2.2 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2], or the AAA Server triggered Network Slice-Specific Re-authentication and Re-authorization procedure fails as specified in clause 4.2.9.2 or the AAA Server triggered Slice-Specific Authorization Revocation takes place as specified in clause 4.2.9.4). 1c. (HPLMN initiated release) This step is the same as step 1b in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - the H-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the H-UPF to stop forwarding downlink traffic. 1d. This step is the same as step 1d in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and - the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request towards H-SMF. 1e. (HPLMN initiated release) This step is the same as step 1e in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - if the H-SMF is notified by the V-SMF that the HPLMN S-NSSAI of the PDU Session with SSC mode 1 or SSC mode 2 is to be replaced with Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and if the H-SMF determines that a new PDU Session is to be established on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI, the H-SMF initiates release of the PDU Session, as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2]; - the H-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the H-UPF to stop forwarding downlink traffic. 1f. This step is the same as step 1f in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and - the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request towards H-SMF. If the SMF receives one of the triggers in step 1a, 1c, 1e or 1f, the H-SMF starts PDU Session Release procedure. When a SMF above initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the UPF to stop forwarding traffic this means also to stop taking into account the traffic for usage monitoring. 2a-2b. (UE-, (R)AN- or Serving network initiated) This step is performed in case the PDU Session Release is triggered by a message from V-SMF. These steps are the same as steps 2a-2b in clause 4.3.4.2. The SMF is the SMF in HPLMN. NOTE 1: This step 2a-2b can correspond to steps 1a, 1b, 1d, 1f. 3a. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The H-SMF prepares the SM Release PDU Session Command message and initiates the PDU Session Release towards the UE by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request service operation towards the V-SMF. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request contains necessary information to build the SM Release PDU Session Command by the V-SMF towards the UE (for example a Release Cause or PCO). For network slice replacement as in step 1e, the H-SMF includes Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and a cause value indicating that a new PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI is required. 3b. (Serving network initiated release) The H-SMF responds to the PDU release request from the V-SMF with a Nsmf_PDUSession_Release response. If the UPF included Small Data Rate Control Status in step 2 then the SMF includes Small Data Rate Control Status in the request to the AMF. If the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU Session, the steps 4a and 4b are skipped. 4a-4b. The V-SMF releases the corresponding User Plane resources. This includes the same procedure in step 2 but controlled from the SMF in VPLMN. 5-13. These steps are the same as steps 3-10 in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - In step 5c, for network slice replacement, based on information from H-SMF, the PDU Session Release Command message may include Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and/or Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI and a cause value indicating that a PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and/or Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI is required. 14. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The V-SMF responds to the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request invoked at step 3a and confirms the PDU Session Release. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Update response may carry information such as PCO received from the UE in SM PDU Session Release Accept. as well as User Location Information, Time Zone and Secondary RAT Usage Data. 15a. (UE or HPLMN or Serving network initiated release) The H-SMF releases the SM policy control association with the PCF by invoking the SM Policy Association Termination procedure defined in clause 4.16.6. For serving network initiated PDU Session Release case, this step happens between step 1b and step 3b. 15b-15c. (HPLMN initiated release) In case the PDU Session Release is HPLMN-initiated (i.e. triggers in 1c, 1e), the H-SMF releases the corresponding User Plane resources. This includes the same procedure as in step 2. 15d. As in step 15 of clause 4.3.4.2, the SMF invokes the Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service operation. NOTE 2: Step 15d does not necessarily take place after step 15c. 16. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The H-SMF shall remove all contexts associated with the PDU Session: 16a. The H-SMF requests the V-SMF to release all contexts associated with the PDU Session by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify (Release) operation. 16b.

The UE indicates to AMF whether it supports non-3GPP access path switching. - In step 2, if the AMF supports MA PDU sessions, then the AMF selects a V-SMF, which supports MA PDU sessions. If the AMF supports non-3GPP access path switching and the UE indicated in step 1 that the UE supports non-3GPP access path switching, the AMF may select a V-SMF and H-SMF supporting non-3GPP access path switching. - In step 3, the AMF informs the V-SMF that the request is for a MA PDU Session (i.e. it includes an ""MA PDU Request"" indication). If the AMF supports non-3GPP access path switching while maintaining two N2 connections for non-3GPP access, the selected SMFs supports non-3GPP path switching and UE indicated in step 1 that the UE supports non-3GPP access path switching, the AMF indicates whether the UE supports non-3GPP path switching to the V-SMF. - In step 6, the V-SMF informs the H-SMF that the request is for a MA PDU Session (i.e. it includes an ""MA PDU Request"" indication). - In step 7, the H-SMF retrieves, via Session Management subscription data, the information whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not. - In step 9, if dynamic PCC is to be used for the MA PDU Session, the H-SMF sends an ""MA PDU Request"" indication to PCF in the SM Policy Control Create message and the ATSSS Capabilities of the MA PDU session. The H-SMF provides the currently used Access Type(s) and RAT Type(s) for the MA-PDU session to the PCF. The PCF decides whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not based on operator policy and subscription data. - In step 14, the V-SMF indicates support of non-3GPP path switching in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message. - In step 16, the UE receives a PDU Session Establishment Accept message, which indicates to UE that the requested MA PDU session was successfully established. This message includes the ATSSS rules for the MA PDU session, which were derived by H-SMF and may include Measurement Assistance Information. - After the MA PDU Session is successfully established on the first access, the UE shall initiate again the MA PDU Session establishment procedure in Figure 4.3.2.2.2-1 over the other access with the following differences and clarifications: - In step 1, the UE shall send another PDU Session Establishment Request over the other access containing the same PDU Session ID that was provided over the first access.

POs,Paging Occasions,Procedure,V,"To avoid possible paging occasion collision and to enhance the likelihood that paging is received successfully for different USIMs, a Multi-USIM UE may need a new 5G-GUTI to modify the timing of the Paging Occasions (POs) for a USIM when the USIM's registration is not emergency registration. When a Multi-USIM UE needs a 5G-GUTI assignment, it performs a Mobility Registration Update without any specific indication (i.e. it is using a normal Registration procedure). This triggers the AMF to allocate a new 5G-GUTI and provide it to the Multi-USIM UE in the Registration Accept message.

The value for Reporting Threshold is set by the PCF based on operator configuration. 2. The PCF is notified with the network performance analytics in the area of interest from the NWDAF when the NWDAF determines that the network performance goes below the threshold as described for the Network Performance analytics in TS 23.288[ Architecture enhancements for 5G System (5GS) to support network data analytics services ]  [50]. 3. The H-PCF may request from the UDR the stored BDT policies using Nudr_DM_Query (Policy Data, Background Data Transfer) service operation. 4. The UDR provides all the Background Transfer Policies together with the relevant information received from the AF (as defined in clause 6.1.2.4 of TS 23.503[ Policy and charging control framework for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 ]  [20]) to the H-PCF. 5. The H-PCF identifies the BDT policies affected by the notification received from NWDAF. For each of them, the H-PCF determines the ASP of which the background traffic will be influenced by the degradation of network performance and which requested the H-PCF to send the notification. The PCF then performs the following steps for each of the determined ASPs, i.e. Steps 6 - 16 can occur multiple times (i.e. once per ASP). 6. The PCF decides based on operator policies, whether a new list of candidate Background Data Transfer policies can be calculated for the ASP. If the PCF does not find any new candidate BDT policy, the previously negotiated BDT policy shall be kept, no interaction with that ASP shall occur and the procedure stops for that BDT policy. NOTE 1: The BDT policies of an ASP which did not request to be notified are kept and no interaction with this ASP occurs. 7. The PCF sets the no longer valid BDT policy in the UDR as invalidated by invoking Nudr_DM_Update (Background Data Transfer Reference ID, invalidation flag) service.

MRO,Mobility Robustness Optimization,Procedure,V,"The following measurement is defined specifically to monitor the performance of handover optimisation: - Number of handover failures for MRO. The measurement examines “handover related events” in which the serving cell of a RRC connected UE is changed. Handover related events are either normal successful handovers, or they are failures. Different failure modes are possible and the measurement provides counts for the occurrences of the failure modes related with MRO, “too early”, “too late” and “to wrong cell”. The detailed definitions of these modes are captured in [12]. The counters provide visibility of the mix of failure problems that the handover optimistion function is tackling. In “handover to wrong cell” case, an RLF occurs shortly after a successful handover from a source cell (cell A in Figure A.13-1) to a target cell (cell B in Figure A.13-1) or a HOF occurs during the handover procedure; the UE attempts to re-establish the radio link connection in a cell (Cell C in Figure A.13-1) other than the source cell and the target cell.

(UE-, (R)AN- or Serving network initiated) This step is performed in case the PDU Session Release is triggered by a message from V-SMF. These steps are the same as steps 2a-2b in clause 4.3.4.2. The SMF is the SMF in HPLMN. NOTE 1: This step 2a-2b can correspond to steps 1a, 1b, 1d, 1f. 3a. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The H-SMF prepares the SM Release PDU Session Command message and initiates the PDU Session Release towards the UE by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request service operation towards the V-SMF. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request contains necessary information to build the SM Release PDU Session Command by the V-SMF towards the UE (for example a Release Cause or PCO). For network slice replacement as in step 1e, the H-SMF includes Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and a cause value indicating that a new PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI is required. 3b. (Serving network initiated release) The H-SMF responds to the PDU release request from the V-SMF with a Nsmf_PDUSession_Release response. If the UPF included Small Data Rate Control Status in step 2 then the SMF includes Small Data Rate Control Status in the request to the AMF. If the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU Session, the steps 4a and 4b are skipped. 4a-4b. The V-SMF releases the corresponding User Plane resources. This includes the same procedure in step 2 but controlled from the SMF in VPLMN. 5-13. These steps are the same as steps 3-10 in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - In step 5c, for network slice replacement, based on information from H-SMF, the PDU Session Release Command message may include Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and/or Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI and a cause value indicating that a PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and/or Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI is required. 14. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The V-SMF responds to the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request invoked at step 3a and confirms the PDU Session Release. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Update response may carry information such as PCO received from the UE in SM PDU Session Release Accept. as well as User Location Information, Time Zone and Secondary RAT Usage Data. 15a. (UE or HPLMN or Serving network initiated release) The H-SMF releases the SM policy control association with the PCF by invoking the SM Policy Association Termination procedure defined in clause 4.16.6. For serving network initiated PDU Session Release case, this step happens between step 1b and step 3b. 15b-15c. (HPLMN initiated release) In case the PDU Session Release is HPLMN-initiated (i.e. triggers in 1c, 1e), the H-SMF releases the corresponding User Plane resources. This includes the same procedure as in step 2. 15d. As in step 15 of clause 4.3.4.2, the SMF invokes the Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service operation. NOTE 2: Step 15d does not necessarily take place after step 15c. 16. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The H-SMF shall remove all contexts associated with the PDU Session: 16a. The H-SMF requests the V-SMF to release all contexts associated with the PDU Session by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify (Release) operation. 16b. The V-SMF requests the AMF to release all contexts associated with the PDU Session by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify (Release).

Paging for EPS services using IMSI,Paging procedure initiated by the Network for error recovery in EPS services using IMSI,Procedure,U,"Paging for EPS services using IMSI is an abnormal procedure used for error recovery in the network.
The network may initiate paging for EPS services using IMSI with CN domain indicator set to ""PS"" if the S-TMSI is not available due to a network failure (see example in figure 5.6.2.2.2.1).
Figure 5.6.2.2.2.1: Paging procedure using IMSI
In S1 mode, to initiate the procedure the EMM entity in the network requests the lower layer to start paging. If the TAI list is not available due to a network failure, the network may perform the paging within all tracking areas served by the MME (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22] and 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]).
When a UE receives a paging for EPS services using IMSI from the network before a UE initiated EMM specific procedure has been completed, then the UE shall abort the EMM specific procedure and proceed according to the description in this clause.
Upon reception of a paging for EPS services using IMSI, the UE shall stop timer T3346, if it is running, locally deactivate any EPS bearer context(s), if any, and locally detach from EPS. Additionally the UE shall delete the following parameters: last visited registered TAI, TAI list, GUTI and KSIASME. The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and change the state to EMM-DEREGISTERED. The UE shall stop all timers T3396 that are running.
If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI, and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when a paging for GPRS services using IMSI is received.
After performing the local detach, the UE shall then perform an attach procedure as described in clause 5.5.1.2. If the UE is operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation, then the UE shall perform a combined attach procedure as described in clause 5.5.1.3. For this attach procedure and its reattempts, if any, the MS shall ignore the contents of the list of ""forbidden tracking areas for roaming"", as well as the list of ""forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service"".
NOTE 1:	In some cases, user interaction can be required, thus the UE cannot activate the dedicated bearer context(s), if any, automatically.
NOTE 2:	The UE does not respond to the paging except with the ATTACH REQUEST message, hence timers T3413 and T3415 in the network are not used when paging with IMSI.",The network initiates paging for EPS services using IMSI with CN domain indicator set to 'PS' if the S-TMSI is not available due to a network failure.,Categorized as a Procedure since it outlines steps taken by the UE and Network in response to an error condition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3GPP TS 24.301
GMM,GPRS Mobility Management,Procedure,V,"The following abnormal cases can be identified: a) Lower layer failure Upon detection of a lower layer failure before the IDENTITY RESPONSE is received, the network shall abort any ongoing GMM procedure. b) Expiry of timer T3370 The identification procedure is supervised by the network by the timer T3370. The network shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3370, retransmit the IDENTITY REQUEST message and reset and restart the timer T3370. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3370, the network shall abort the identification procedure and any ongoing GMM procedure. c) Collision of an identification procedure with a GPRS attach procedure If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been completed and no GPRS attach procedure is pending on the network (i.e. no ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT message has still to be sent as an answer to an ATTACH REQUEST message), the network shall proceed with the GPRS attach procedure. d) Collision of an identification procedure with a GPRS attach procedure when the identification procedure has been caused by a GPRS attach procedure If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been completed and a GPRS attach procedure is pending (i.e. an ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT message has to be sent as an answer to an earlier ATTACH REQUEST message), then: - If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST message differs from the ones received within the previous ATTACH REQUEST message, the network shall proceed with the GPRS attach procedure; or - If the information elements do not differ, then the network shall not treat any further this new ATTACH REQUEST. d1) Collision of an identification procedure with an MS initiated GPRS detach procedure GPRS detach containing cause ""power off"": If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been completed, the network shall abort the identification procedure and shall progress the GPRS detach procedure.

IOPS,Isolated Operation,Mode,V,"This approach to the provision of isolated operation (e.g. when there is no S1 connectivity to the macro EPC) assumes that the IOPS-capable eNodeB is co-sited with, or can reach, a Local EPC instance which is used in IOPS mode. The Local EPC instance includes at least MME, SGW/PDN GW and HSS functionality. A PLMN identity is dedicated to IOPS mode of operation and is broadcast in System Information by the eNodeB when IOPS mode is in operation. Only authorized IOPS-enabled UEs can access a PLMN indicated as an IOPS PLMN. Support of application services over the IOPS network will be based upon the LTE-Uu radio interface and EPS bearer services supported by the Local EPC. An IOPS network will provide local connectivity services, i.e. for an IP PDN type, IP address assignment and local routing in the IOPS network. For an IP PDN type, During the attachment procedure to the local EPC a local IP address is assigned to the UE as per the standard procedure when attaching to a Macro EPC. The Local EPC acts as a router among the UEs locally attached to the same IOPS network. When operating in IOPS mode IOPS-enabled UEs only use the appropriate USIM credentials defined in the UICC, i.e. those defined exclusively for use in an IOPS PLMN.","Isolated Operation (IOPS) is a mode of operation that enables isolated network functionality when there is no S1 connectivity to the macro Evolved Packet Core (EPC). In this mode, an IOPS-capable eNodeB works in conjunction with a co-sited or reachable Local EPC instance, which includes essential functionalities like Mobility Management Entity (MME), Serving and Packet Data Network Gateway (SGW/PDN GW), and Home Subscriber Server (HSS). The Local EPC operates in IOPS mode, broadcasting a dedicated Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) identity. Only authorized User Equipment (UE) with IOPS capabilities can access this isolated network, leveraging the LTE-Uu radio interface and Evolved Packet System (EPS) bearer services for local connectivity and application services.","IOPS is classified as a Mode because it describes a specific operational state of the network where isolated functionality is enabled under certain conditions.

SSC,Slice Specific Configuration,Mode,V,"In order to support selective traffic routing to the DN or to support SSC mode 3 as defined in clause 5.6.9.2.3, the SMF may control the data path of a PDU Session so that the PDU Session may simultaneously correspond to multiple N6 interfaces. The UPF that terminates each of these interfaces is said to support PDU Session Anchor functionality. Each PDU Session Anchor supporting a PDU Session provides a different access to the same DN. Further, the PDU Session Anchor assigned at PDU Session Establishment is associated with the SSC mode of the PDU Session and the additional PDU Session Anchor(s) assigned within the same PDU Session e.g. for selective traffic routing to the DN are independent of the SSC mode of the PDU Session.

The RQ Timer value provided by the core network is at the granularity of PDU Session (the details are specified in TS 24.501[ Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System (5GS); Stage 3 ]  [47]). When the 5GC determines that Reflective QoS has to be used for a specific SDF belonging to a QoS Flow, the SMF shall provide the RQA (Reflective QoS Attribute) within the QoS Flow's QoS profile to the NG-RAN on N2 reference point unless it has been done so before. When the RQA has been provided to the NG-RAN for a QoS Flow and the 5GC determines that the QoS Flow carries no more SDF for which Reflective QoS has to be used, the SMF should signal the removal of the RQA (Reflective QoS Attribute) from the QoS Flow's QoS profile to the NG-RAN on N2 reference point. NOTE 1: The SMF could have a timer to delay the sending of the removal of the RQA. This would avoid signalling to the RAN in the case of new SDFs subject to Reflective QoS are bound to this QoS Flow in the meantime.

When the serving AMF provides the Configured NSSAI to the UE, and the UE has indicated it supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature, the AMF also provides the UE with the NSSRG information related to the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN which are in the mapping information of the Configured NSSAI.

RNA,RAN Area,NetworkFunction_Group,U,"Mobility procedures for multicast reception allow the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state to continue receiving MBS service(s) when changing cells without resuming RRC connection if the PTM configuration of the new cell can be acquired by the UE from the multicast MCCH after cell reselection. During an active MBS multicast session, the UE is required to resume RRC connection to get the PTM configuration if the PTM configuration is not provided on the multicast MCCH of the new cell. Even if the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state received indication to stop monitoring PDCCH addressed by G-RNTI for an MBS multicast session in the source cell, the UE acquires MCCH in the reselected cell after cell reselection. The gNB may indicate in the multicast MCCH the list of neighbour cells providing the same MBS multicast service(s) for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state as provided in the serving cell. This allows the UE, e.g., to resume RRC connection without reading SIB24 and multicast MCCH of the neighbour cell, if the interested service which is activated is not available to the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state. The gNB may provide an indication on cell PDCP COUNT synchronization for an MBS session with PTM configuration in RRCRelease message. If indicated by the gNB, all cells within the RNA are synchronized in terms of PDCP COUNT value to the MRBs of the corresponding MBS service, and the order of MRBs within the list of multicast MRB configuration for the same MBS multicast session in the multicast MCCH message of the last serving cell and (re)selected cell within the RNA should be consistent. Upon reselection to a cell indicated as synchronized in terms of PDCP COUNT value, the UE does not initialize the PDCP state variables. Otherwise, the UE initializes the PDCP state variables as defined in TS 38.323[ NR; Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) specification ]  [8]. The UE may be configured with dedicated frequency priorities in RRCRelease message which the UE applies during cell reselection while receiving data of MBS multicast session in RRC_INACTIVE state. The UE receiving multicast session(s) in RRC_INACTIVE state triggers RRC connection resumption if the latest measured RSRP or RSRQ of the serving cell becomes lower than the threshold configured by the network. The threshold can be configured per MBS session via RRCRelease message or multicast MCCH.","A RAN Area (RNA) is a group of cells within a Radio Access Network (RAN) that are synchronized in terms of PDCP COUNT value for an MBS session with PTM configuration. This synchronization allows UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state to resume RRC connection without initializing the PDCP state variables when reselecting to a cell within the RNA, ensuring seamless service continuity for multicast reception.","RNA is classified as a NetworkFunction_Group because it refers to a collective set of interconnected network functions (cells) that work together to deliver specific telecommunications capabilities, such as synchronized PDCP COUNT values for MBS sessions, enabling efficient service continuity and mobility management within the RAN.",3GPP TS 38.300,16.10.5.3.5 Service Continuity in RRC_INACTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the following description for tracking area updating for SMS services applies.
In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested ""SMS only"" in the Additional update type IE and supports NB-S1 mode only, the MME decides to accept the tracking area update request for EPS services only and:
-	the location update for non-EPS services is not accepted by the VLR as specified in 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A]; or
-	the MME decides to not accept the tracking area update request for ""SMS only"",
the MME shall set the EPS update result IE to ""EPS only"", shall not indicate ""SMS only"" in the Additional update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and shall include an appropriate SMS services status value.
The UE receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message takes one of the following actions depending on the value included in the SMS services status IE:
""SMS services not available""
The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

EMM cause #15,EPS Mobility Management Cause #15,Cause Code,V,"If the UE supports disabling and re-enabling of UE's NB-IoT capability and the UE in NB-S1 mode is disabling the NB-IoT capability, it should proceed as follows:
a)	select E-UTRAN, or for the UE which supports CIoT EPS optimization select satellite E-UTRAN via ""WB-E-UTRAN(LEO)"", ""WB-E-UTRAN(MEO)"", or ""WB-E-UTRAN(GEO)"", of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs;
b)	if E-UTRAN, or for the UE which supports CIoT EPS optimization if satellite E-UTRAN via ""WB-E-UTRAN(LEO)"", ""WB-E-UTRAN(MEO)"", or ""WB-E-UTRAN(GEO)"", of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs cannot be found, select another RAT (GERAN, UTRAN, or NG-RAN if the UE has not disabled its N1 mode capability for 3GPP access as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs;
c)	if another RAT of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs cannot be found, or the UE does not have a registered PLMN, then perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. As an implementation option, instead of performing PLMN selection, the UE may select another RAT of the chosen PLMN; or
d)	if no other allowed PLMN and RAT combinations are available, then the UE may re-enable the NB-IoT capability and remain registered for EPS services in NB-IoT of the registered PLMN. If the UE chooses this option, then it may periodically attempt to select another PLMN and RAT combination that can provide non-EPS services. How this periodic scanning is done, is UE implementation dependent.
If the NB-IoT capability is disabled, the UE shall re-enable the NB-IoT capability when:
-	performing a PLMN selection unless the UE has already re-enabled the NB-IoT capability when performing bullet c) or d) above; or
-	the UE powers off and powers on again or the USIM is removed.
If the UE in NB-S1 mode receives an ATTACH REJECT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message including both EMM cause #15 ""no suitable cells in tracking area"" and an Extended EMM cause IE with value ""NB-IoT not allowed"" after the UE requests access to the NB-IoT, in order to prevent unwanted cell reselection from GERAN, UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN to NB-IoT, the UE may:
-	disable the NB-IoT capability:
-	indicate the access stratum layer(s) of disabling of the NB-IoT capability; and
-	memorize the identity of the PLMN where the NB-IoT capability was disabled and use that stored information in subsequent PLMN selections as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].
NOTE:	The UE can only disable the NB-IoT capability when in EMM-IDLE mode.
If the UE in NB-S1 mode is required to disable the NB-IoT capability and select E-UTRAN radio access technology, and the UE is in the EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE shall locally release the established NAS signalling connection and enter the EMM-IDLE mode before selecting E-UTRAN radio access technology.
As an implementation option, the UE may start a timer for enabling the NB-IoT capability. On expiry of this timer, the UE may enable the NB-IoT capability.",A signal indicating that there are no suitable cells in the tracking area.,Categorized as a Protocol Signal because it is used to convey specific information between network components.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3GPP TS 24.301

In this scenario the authentication server role is taken by the AAA Server. The AUSF acts as EAP authenticator and interacts with the AAA Server to execute the primary authentication procedure. The architecture for SNPN access using credentials from a Credentials Holder using AAA Server is described in clause 5.30.2.9.2 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2].,"In the context of 3GPP specifications, particularly within clause 5.30.2.9.2 of TS 23.501 describing the system architecture for the 5G System (5GS), User Equipments (UEs) refer to devices used by end-users to access and communicate through the network.

GPRS MSs,GPRS Mobile Stations,UE,V,"This clause describes the procedures used for mobility management for non-GPRS services and for GPRS-services at the radio interface (Reference Point Um and Uu). The main function of the Mobility Management sublayer is to support the mobility of user terminals, such as informing the network of its present location and providing user identity confidentiality. A further function of the MM sublayer is to provide connection management services to the different entities of the upper Connection Management (CM) sublayer (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]). There are two sets of procedures defined in this chapter: - MM procedures for non-GPRS services (performed by the MM entity of the MM sublayer); and - GMM procedures for GPRS services (performed by the GMM entity of the MM sublayer), see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]. All the MM procedures described in this clause can only be performed if a RR connection has been established between the MS and the network. Else, the MM sublayer has to initiate the establishment of a RR connection (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 3.3 and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]). In A/Gb mode, the GMM procedures described in this clause, use services provided by the RR sublayer without prior RR connection establishment. In Iu mode: all the GMM procedures described in this clause can only be performed if a PS signalling connection has been established between the MS and the network. Else, the GMM sublayer has to initiate the establishment of a PS signalling connection (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]). GMM procedures are mandatory and applicable only for GPRS MSs and networks supporting those MSs. For GPRS MSs which are IMSI attached for both GPRS and non-GPRS services, some MM procedures are replaced by GMM combined procedures provided that the network operates in network operation mode I, i.e. is supporting combined GMM procedures. GMM combined procedures are not applicable for the GPRS MS operation mode C but are mandatory for the GPRS MS operation modes A and B and networks supporting network operation mode I, see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74].",The GPRS MSs are mobile devices that support GPRS services and use GMM procedures for mobility management.,Classified as UE because it represents end-user devices interacting with the network.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TS.23.008
UE,User Equipment,UE,V,"A UE may support the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature. In this case, the UE indicates its support in the Registration Request message in the Initial Registration and the Mobility Registration Update as part of the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability. When the serving AMF provides the Configured NSSAI to the UE, and the UE has indicated it supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature, the AMF also provides the UE with the NSSRG information related to the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN which are in the mapping information of the Configured NSSAI. A UE which receives the NSSRG values in the network slicing configuration information shall only include in the Requested NSSAI S-NSSAIs that share a common NSSRG as per the received information. If the UE has stored Pending NSSAI and the UE is still interested in the Pending NSSAI then all the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI and the Pending S-NSSAI shall share a common NSSRG. If the HPLMN changes NSSRG information in the subscription information for a UE, the UDM updates the supporting AMF serving the UE with the new NSSRG information and the AMF, possibly after interaction with the NSSF (see clause 5.2.16.2.1 of TS 23.502[ Procedures for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3]), updates the UE as necessary with network slicing configuration by means of the UE Configuration Update procedure (this may include changes in the Configured NSSAI (and related mapping information) and changes in the Allowed NSSAI as applicable). The UE acknowledges this UE Configuration Update according to clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502[ Procedures for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3]. At any time, a UE supporting subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature and that has received NSSRG information together with the Configured NSSAI shall only request S-NSSAIs, across all Access Type(s) regardless of whether the same PLMN or different PLMNs are used, that share one or more common NSSRG. NOTE: In Requested NSSAI across all Access Type(s), the UE needs to include S-NSSAIs that share at least one common NSSRG. An AMF which supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slice feature configures a non-supporting UE with a Configured NSSAI including only the S-NSSAIs sharing all the NSSRG values of the default S-NSSAI(s), except if it has been instructed otherwise by the UDM. In addition to the default S-NSSAI(s), the AMF sends to the UE in the Configured NSSAI any other subscribed S-NSSAI whose NSSRG match at least those defined for the default S-NSSAI(s). The UDM in a supporting HPLMN may optionally keep a record of the PEIs or Type Allocation Codes values regarding UE ability to handle network slices that cannot be provided simultaneously in Allowed NSSAI. The UDM may, based on configuration or the optional PEI records, indicate the AMF to provide the non-supporting UEs with the full set of subscribed S-NSSAIs even if they do not share a common NSSRG. The UDM instructs the supporting AMFs of a PLMN to do so by indicating that the UE can be given a Configured NSSAI with all the S-NSSAIs in the subscription information. If this indication is received from the UDM by the AMF, this is included in the UE context. Based on its policy (including configuration or optionally checking the specific PEI or Type Allocation Code used by the UE, and subject to roaming agreement) the UDM may also provide the serving AMF in a non-supporting VPLMN with all the S-NSSAI in the subscription information. In this case the AMF provides the UE with a Configured NSSAI including all the S-NSSAIs in the subscription information the AMF receives. The AMF provides no NSSRG information to a non-supporting UE. When an AMF which supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slice feature, receives from a UE a Requested NSSAI including S-NSSAIs that are supported in the Tracking Area but do not share a common NSSRG, or the AMF has pending NSSAI stored for the UE, and the S-NSSAI(s) of the requested NSSAI and the pending NSSAI do not share a common NSSRG, the AMF assumes the UE configuration is not up-to-date, and provides the following: - a supporting UE with an updated configuration including the up-to-date NSSRG information for the S-NSSAIs in the Configured NSSAI as described above. - a non-supporting UE with an updated Configured NSSAI including only the S-NSSAIs sharing all the NSSRG values of the default S-NSSAI(s), only for the case where the UE context does not include an indication to provide all the subscribed S-NSSAIs in the subscription information in the Configured NSSAI for the UE.","The User Equipment (UE) is a device that connects to a telecommunication network, supporting various features and capabilities as defined by 3GPP specifications.

HARQ,Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request,protocol/Procedure,U,"The PDU Set Error Rate (PSER) defines an upper bound for the rate of PDU Sets that have been processed by the sender of a link layer protocol (e.g. RLC in RAN of a 3GPP access) but that are not successfully delivered by the corresponding receiver to the upper layer (e.g. PDCP in RAN of a 3GPP access). Thus, the PSER defines an upper bound for a rate of non-congestion related PDU Set losses. The purpose of the PSER is to allow for appropriate link layer protocol configurations (e.g. RLC and HARQ in RAN of a 3GPP access). NOTE 1: In this Release, a PDU Set is considered as successfully delivered only when all PDUs of a PDU Set are delivered successfully. NOTE 2: How RAN enforces PSER is up to RAN implementation. A QoS Flow is associated with at most one PDU Set Error Rate value per direction. PSER is an optional parameter.

RRM,Radio Resource Management,Network Function,V,"Radio resource management functions are concerned with the allocation and maintenance of radio communication paths, and are performed by the radio access network. RRM includes both idle mode and connected mode. The RRM strategy in E-UTRAN may be based on user specific information. To support radio resource management in E-UTRAN the MME provides the parameter 'Index to RAT/Frequency Selection Priority' (RFSP Index) to an eNodeB across S1. The RFSP Index is mapped by the eNodeB to locally defined configuration in order to apply specific RRM strategies. The RFSP Index is UE specific and applies to all the Radio Bearers. Examples of how this parameter may be used by the E-UTRAN: - to derive UE specific cell reselection priorities to control idle mode camping. - to decide on redirecting active mode UEs to different frequency layers or RATs. To provide additional support to radio resource management in E-UTRAN, the MME may provide the parameter 'Additional RRM Policy Index' (ARPI) to an eNodeB across S1. The ARPI is mapped by the eNodeB to locally defined configuration in order to apply specific RRM strategies. An example of how this parameter may be used by the E-UTRAN is: - to prioritise the allocation of RAN resources to the set of UEs with the same ARPI. The Serving PLMN can use the ARPI to carry information that is independent to the Reference SPID values documented in Informative Annex I of TS 36.300[ Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2 ]  [5]. The MME receives the subscribed RFSP Index and subscribed ARPI from the HSS (e.g., during the Attach procedure). For non-roaming subscribers the MME chooses the RFSP Index and ARPI in use according to one of the following procedures, depending on operator's configuration: - the RFSP Index in use is identical to the subscribed RFSP Index, or - the MME chooses the RFSP Index in use based on the subscribed RFSP Index, the locally configured operator's policies and the UE related context information available at the MME, including UE's usage setting and voice domain preference for E-UTRAN, if received during Attach and Tracking Area Update procedures (see clause 4.3.5.9). NOTE: One example of how the MME can use the ""UE voice capabilities and settings"" is to select an RFSP value that enforces idle mode camping on 2G/3G for a UE acting in a ""Voice centric"" way and provisioned with ""CS Voice preferred, IMS Voice as secondary"", in order to minimize the occurrancy of RAT changes. Another example is the selection of an RFSP value that prevents idle mode camping on 2G for a UE provisioned with ""IMS PS voice preferred, CS Voice as secondary"" if other RATs supporting IMS Voice are available, as the UE would in such case always select the CS domain for its voice calls. - the ARPI In Use is identical to the subscribed ARPI, or - the MME chooses the ARPI in use based on the subscribed ARPI, the locally configured operator's policies and the UE related context information available at the MME. For roaming subscribers the MME may alternatively choose the RFSP Index and ARPI in use based on the visited network policy, but can take input from the HPLMN into account (e.g., an RFSP Index value/ARPI value pre-configured per HPLMN, or a single RFSP Index value/single ARPI value to be used for all roamers independent of the HPLMN). The MME forwards the RFSP Index and ARPI in use to the eNodeB across S1. The RFSP Index and ARPI in use is also forwarded from source eNodeB to target eNodeB when X2 is used for intra-E-UTRAN handover, UE context retrieval, or, Dual Connectivity with a secondary RAN node. The MME stores the subscribed RFSP Index and ARPI values received from the HSS and the RFSP Index and ARPI values in use. During the Tracking Area Update procedure, the MME may update the RFSP Index/ARPI value in use (e.g. the MME may need to update the RFSP Index/ARPI value in use if the UE related context information in the MME has changed). When the RFSP Index/ARPI value in use is changed, the MME immediately provides the updated RFSP Index/ARPI value in use to eNodeB by modifying an existing UE context or by establishing an new UE context in the eNodeB or by being configured to include the updated RFSP Index/ARPI value in use in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message if the user plane establishment is not needed. During inter-MME mobility procedures, the source MME forwards both RFSP Index values and both ARPI values to the target MME. The target MME may replace the received RFSP Index and ARPI values in use with a new RFSP Index value in use or new ARPI value in use that is based on the operator's policies and the UE related context information available at the target MME. The S1 messages that transfer the RFSP Index and ARPI to the eNodeB are specified in TS 36.413[ Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); S1 Application Protocol (S1AP) ]  [36]. Refer to TS 36.300[ Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2 ]  [5] for further information on E-UTRAN. To support a RAN with a mixture of RAN nodes that support and do not support the ARPI, the MME sends the ARPI In Use in the S1 interface PATCH SWITCH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT and HANDOVER REQUEST messages.","Radio Resource Management (RRM) is a set of functions that manage the allocation and maintenance of radio communication paths within a radio access network, encompassing both idle and connected modes.",RRM is classified under Telecommunications Concept because it deals with the management of radio resources in wireless communication systems.,3GPP TS 23.401,4.3.6 Radio Resource Management functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GEA,GPRS Encryption Algorithm,Algiorithm,V,"A UMTS security context in UTRAN is only established for UMTS subscribers. At the network side, four cases are distinguished: a) In case of an intersystem change to a GSM BSS controlled by the same SGSN, the SGSN derives the 64-bit GSM cipher key Kc from the UMTS cipher/integrity keys CK and IK agreed during the latest UMTS AKA procedure (using the conversion function c3) and applies it if the selected GEA ciphering algorithm requires a 64-bit key. b) In case of an intersystem change to a GSM BSS controlled by another R99+ SGSN, the initial SGSN sends the UMTS cipher/integrity keys CK and IK agreed during the latest UMTS AKA procedure to the new SGSN. The new SGSN stores the keys, derives the 64-bit GSM cipher key Kc and applies the latter. The new SGSN becomes the new anchor point for the service. c) In case of an intersystem change to a GSM BSS controlled by a R98- SGSN, the initial SGSN derives the GSM cipher key Kc from the UMTS cipher/integrity keys CK and IK agreed during the latest UMTS AKA procedure and sends the GSM cipher key Kc to the new SGSN. The new SGSN stores the GSM cipher key Kc and applies it.
