# Named_EntityType_Classifications:


Entity type classification is a crucial aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in the field of telecommunications, where accurately identifying and categorizing terms can significantly enhance data understanding and processing. We are  Working within the telecom domain, specifically in the context of 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) specifications, entity types can be classified into several categories, including Protocols, Network Functions, and Services. So far we have Introduced 19 disntinct Telecom Entity Type:

Definition: Identifiers are unique numbers or codes used to recognize and manage devices and users in a telecommunications network.

    Examples:
        IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity)
        IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)
        MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number)

# 7. Channel

Definition: Channels represent the communication pathways used for transmitting data, each supporting different types of data transmission technologies.

    Examples:
         PCH(Paging Channel)
         PDSCH(Physical Downlink Shared Channel)
         PUSSCH(Physical Uplink Shared Channel)
         PUCCH(Physical Uplink Control Channel)
        
# 8. Technology

Definition: Technologies refer to the specific technical methods and innovations used to implement telecommunications services and infrastructure.

    Examples:
        5G NR (New Radio)
        UTRA (Universal Terrestrial Radio Access)
        LTE (Long-Term Evolution)
        GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)
        WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access)


# 9. Procedure

Definition: Procedures are systematic processes defined in telecommunications protocols that dictate how specific actions are to be carried out.

    Examples:
        Attach Procedure
        Handover Procedure
        Detach Procedure

# 10. Message

Definition: Messages are data packets or signals exchanged between network elements to facilitate communication and service delivery.

    Examples:
        Initial Context Setup Request
        Handover Request
        Attach Accept

# 11. Specification

Definition: Specifications are formal documents that define the standards and requirements for various telecommunications protocols and technologies.

    Examples:
        3GPP TS 23.401
        3GPP TS 23.502
        3GPP TS 36.300

# 12. Organization

Definition: Organizations are entities that develop, promote, and manage telecommunications standards and regulations.

    Examples:
        3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project)
        ITU (International Telecommunication Union)
        ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute)

# 13. User Equipment (UE)/DEVICE


Definition: User equipment refers to the devices used by subscribers to access telecommunications services.

    Examples:
        Smartphone
        Tablet
        IoT Device

# 14. Timer

Definition: Timers are mechanisms used in telecommunications protocols to manage time-sensitive operations and actions.

    Examples:
        T300 Timer
        T320 Timer
        T3512 Timer

# 15. State

Definition: States indicate the current operational status of a User Equipment (UE) or network component at any given time.

    Examples:
        Idle State
        Connected State
        Disconnected State

# 16. Mode

Definition: Modes refer to the operational configurations of a device or network that determine how communication occurs.

    Examples:
        Connected Mode
        Disconnected Mode
