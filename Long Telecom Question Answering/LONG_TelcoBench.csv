0,"What happens to the UE's behavior on an SCell when it is deactivated, specifically regarding PDCCH/PDSCH reception, uplink transmission, and CQI measurements?","When an SCell is deactivated, the UE does not need to receive the corresponding PDCCH or PDSCH. This means that the UE will not be actively listening for control channel messages or data transmissions on this specific cell. Additionally, the UE cannot transmit in the corresponding uplink and is not required to perform CQI measurements.","Deactivation of an SCell results in a reduction of the UE's activities related to that cell. Specifically, the UE stops monitoring PDCCH for scheduling information and does not receive PDSCH data transmissions on this cell. Furthermore, uplink transmission capabilities are suspended, meaning the UE will not transmit any data or control signals on this deactivated SCell. Lastly, CQI measurements, which provide feedback about channel conditions to the network, are also halted.","From a power consumption perspective, deactivating an SCell allows the UE to conserve energy by reducing its monitoring and transmission activities. When an SCell is in a deactivated state, the UE does not need to continuously monitor PDCCH for potential scheduling assignments or receive data via PDSCH. This reduction in activity also extends to uplink transmissions, where the UE will refrain from transmitting on this cell unless it is reactivated. Moreover, CQI measurements are suspended during deactivation, further minimizing the UE's energy expenditure related to this SCell.",3GPP TS 38.300,10.6 Activation/Deactivation Mechanism,RAN2,"3GPP Series : 38 , Radio technology beyond LTE"

6,"What is the primary purpose of the 'Service Reject' message sent by the network to the User Equipment, and what are the implications for the ongoing service request procedure?","The primary purpose of the 'Service Reject' message is to notify the User Equipment that its Service Request has been rejected by the network. This rejection implies that the UE's request for a specific service or resource cannot be fulfilled at this time, and the UE should not attempt to re-initiate the request until the underlying issue causing the rejection is resolved.","The 'Service Reject' message serves as a control mechanism allowing the network to manage its resources effectively. By rejecting a Service Request, the network can prevent overloading or misallocation of resources, ensuring that available capacity is utilized efficiently among competing requests. This rejection also prompts the UE to reassess its service requirements and potentially modify its request before re-submission.","The 'Service Reject' message has significant implications for the ongoing service request procedure, as it necessitates a re-evaluation of the UE's service needs and priorities. Upon receiving this message, the UE must analyze the cause of rejection and consider alternative services or resource configurations that might be acceptable to both the UE and the network. This iterative process enables the UE and network to engage in a dynamic negotiation, ultimately leading to an optimized allocation of resources and improved overall network performance.",3GPP TS 24.008,9.4.22 Service Reject (Iu mode only),CT WG1,"3GPP Series : 24 , Signalling protocols (""stage 3"") - user equipment to network"

8,What are the potential consequences for a User Equipment (UE) that fails to meet the specified average probability of miss-detecting ACK for NACK threshold in terms of its transmit diversity performance?,"If a UE fails to meet this threshold, it may lead to reduced reliability in Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request processes. This is because the UE's inability to accurately detect ACK/NACK signals can result in increased error rates and decreased throughput.","To mitigate the impact of failing to meet this threshold, a UE could implement advanced signal processing techniques, such as machine learning-based detection algorithms or adaptive filtering methods. These techniques can help improve the accuracy of ACK/NACK detection and reduce the likelihood of errors.","In cases where a UE consistently fails to meet this threshold, it may be beneficial for the network to adjust its transmission parameters, such as power levels or modulation schemes, to compensate for the UE's limitations.

This allows the UE to manage retransmissions independently, reducing the impact of LBT failures on URLLC services.","In this scenario, the UE's handling of potential LBT failures is further optimized when enhanced intra-UE overlapping resource prioritization mechanisms are also configured. With these mechanisms in place, the UE may be instructed to select the HARQ process for a CG resource based on logical channel priority, ensuring that higher-priority traffic is given precedence over lower-priority traffic during retransmissions.","The optional configuration of the CG retransmission timer and enhanced intra-UE overlapping resource prioritization mechanisms provides a flexible framework for managing LBT failures in URLLC services.

In this scenario, the network rejects the NAS signalling connection establishment, limiting the UE's ability to initiate most EMM procedures.","This particular state occurs under two distinct scenarios: (1) when the access class of the UE is blocked due to access class control mechanisms enforced by the network; and (2) when the network explicitly rejects the NAS signalling connection establishment attempt made by the UE. Both conditions restrict the UE from initiating any EMM procedure except for tracking area updating, combined tracking area updating, or service request in response to paging.","The UE enters this restricted state primarily due to two reasons: (1) Access Class Control: When the network applies access class control measures that block the UE's access class, thereby preventing it from accessing the current cell. This could be a result of various policies or restrictions imposed by the network operator; and (2) NAS Signalling Connection Rejection: When the network rejects the UE's attempt to establish a NAS signalling connection. In both cases, the UE is limited in its ability to initiate EMM procedures, with exceptions made for tracking area updating, combined tracking area updating, and service request initiated as a response to paging from the network.",3GPP TS 24.301,5.1.3.2.4.6 EMM-REGISTERED.UPDATE-NEEDED,CT WG1,"3GPP Series : 24 , Signalling protocols (""stage 3"") - user equipment to network"

80,"Describe the key steps involved in the multicast service deactivation procedure, including the roles of UE, GGSN, BM-SC, and SGSN, and explain how this process ensures efficient resource management in the network.","The multicast service deactivation procedure involves several critical steps. First, the User Equipment (UE) sends an IGMP or MLD Leave message to indicate its intention to leave a specific MBMS multicast service identified by an IP multicast address. This triggers the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) to send a Session Termination Request to the Broadcast Multicast Service Centre (BM-SC), which then verifies the IP multicast address and sends a Session Termination Acknowledgement back to the GGSN. The GGSN subsequently sends an MBMS UE Context Deactivation Request to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN), leading to the deletion of the MBMS UE Context. Finally, the GGSN confirms the successful deactivation by sending another Session Termination Request to the BM-SC.","From a network perspective, the multicast service deactivation procedure is crucial for efficient resource management. The process begins with the UE's Leave message, which prompts the GGSN to initiate the deactivation sequence. This involves communicating with the BM-SC to verify the multicast service details and obtain confirmation before proceeding with the deletion of the MBMS UE Context at the SGSN. Notably, if no other users are interested in the specific MBMS bearer service, the GGSN may also trigger a De-Registration procedure as part of this process.","A detailed examination of the multicast service deactivation procedure reveals several critical steps that ensure seamless and efficient termination of user registration to an MBMS multicast service. Initially, the UE's Leave message sets off a chain of events involving the GGSN, BM-SC, and SGSN. Each entity plays a distinct role: the GGSN handles the initial request and communicates with the BM-SC for verification; the BM-SC confirms the details and sends an acknowledgement; and the SGSN deletes the MBMS UE Context based on the received request.",3GPP TS 29.061,17.5.7 Service deactivation,CT WG3,"3GPP Series : 29 , Signalling protocols (""stage 3"") - intra-fixed-network"
81,"What is the relationship between EPS Mobility Management (EMM) states and EPS Connection Management (ECM) states, specifically regarding transitions between EMM-REGISTERED and EMM-DEREGISTERED states?","The EMM and ECM states are generally independent of each other. However, there are specific relationships that govern the transitions between certain states. For instance, transitioning from EMM-REGISTERED to EMM-DEREGISTERED can occur regardless of the ECM state, meaning it can happen whether the UE is in ECM-CONNECTED or ECM-IDLE. Conversely, to transition from EMM-DEREGISTERED to EMM-REGISTERED, the UE must be in the ECM-CONNECTED state.","The relationship between EMM and ECM states allows for some level of independence but also defines critical dependencies for specific transitions. Notably, a UE can move from EMM-REGISTERED to EMM-DEREGISTERED without being tied to a particular ECM state; this could be due to explicit detach signaling while in ECM-CONNECTED or implicit detach during ECM-IDLE. However, the reverse transition (from EMM-DEREGISTERED to EMM-REGISTERED) requires the UE to establish a connection, thus necessitating the ECM-CONNECTED state.","While EMM and ECM states operate independently in many aspects, their interaction is crucial for managing mobility and connections effectively. Specifically, transitions between EMM-REGISTERED and EMM-DEREGISTERED are subject to certain conditions related to the ECM state. The system allows flexibility by permitting detachment (transitioning from EMM-REGISTERED to EMM-DEREGISTERED) in both connected and idle ECM states. However, re-registration (moving from EMM-DEREGISTERED to EMM-REGISTERED) mandates a connected state, underscoring the importance of signaling connectivity for successful registration processes.",3GPP TS 23.401,4.6 EPS Mobility Management and Connection Management states 4.6.1 General,SA WG2,"3GPP Series : 23 , Technical realization (""stage 2"")"

This indicates that the DRB has multiple mappings and releasing it would impact other active QoS flows, hence the gNB decides to only release the specific QFI to DRB mapping rule.","The main reason for not releasing the DRB in this scenario is to maintain continuity of service for the UE. Since the DRB carries multiple QoS flows and releasing it would disrupt these active flows, the gNB prioritizes maintaining network stability by only updating the specific QFI to DRB mapping rule.","The decision not to release the DRB in step 2 is primarily driven by resource optimization considerations.

Periodical reporting is configured using a parameter that dictates the regular interval at which measurements are logged and reported. In contrast, event-triggered reporting is configured where an event triggers the logging of measurements based on specific conditions like threshold crossings or hysteresis levels. This difference significantly impacts how User Equipment logs measurement results; periodical reporting ensures consistent, time-based logging useful for general network performance monitoring, while event-triggered reporting allows for more dynamic and condition-based logging that can capture critical network events.","The LoggedMeasurementConfiguration message supports two distinct reporting configurations - periodical and event-triggered. Periodical reporting involves the periodic transmission of logged measurements at fixed intervals, which is beneficial for continuous monitoring of network performance over time. On the other hand, event-triggered reporting allows for more flexible logging based on specific events or conditions such as coverage loss or signal strength thresholds. This flexibility in event-triggered reporting enables targeted logging that can be tailored to capture critical network behaviors or anomalies without the need for constant periodic reports.","From a practical perspective, the key difference between periodical and event-triggered reporting is their application in optimizing network performance.

182,What are the conditions under which a default EPS bearer context is activated in the MME when the User Equipment (UE) is in the EMM-REGISTERED state?,"A default EPS bearer context is activated in the MME when the UE is in the EMM-REGISTERED state if either the UE or the MME does not support connectivity without a PDN connection. This ensures that a basic level of connectivity is established, even if advanced features are not supported.","The activation of a default EPS bearer context in the MME occurs when the UE is in the EMM-REGISTERED state and has requested connectivity to a Packet Data Network (PDN). This request triggers the establishment of a default EPS bearer context, enabling the UE to access packet-switched services.","In the EMM-REGISTERED state, a default EPS bearer context is activated in the MME under two conditions. Firstly, if neither the UE nor the MME supports connectivity without a PDN connection, a default bearer is established by default. Secondly, even if both the UE and MME support connectivity without PDN connection, a default EPS bearer context can still be activated if the UE explicitly requests connectivity to a PDN.",3GPP TS 24.301,5.1.3.4.3 EMM-REGISTERED,CT WG1,"3GPP Series : 24 , Signalling protocols (""stage 3"") - user equipment to network"
183,"In a scenario where a User Equipment initiates a connection to a 5G network and sends a piggybacked initial message for dedicated bearer activation along with the default bearer request, what happens if the processing of the dedicated bearer activation message results in an error?","If the processing of the dedicated bearer activation message results in an error, it does not affect the default bearer establishment. This means that even though there was an issue with setting up a dedicated bearer for specific traffic, the basic connectivity (default bearer) will still be established successfully.","In such a scenario, since the question specifically asks about the case where the error occurs in processing the dedicated bearer activation message, it's crucial to note that this error does not impact the default bearer setup. The network will still attempt to establish the default bearer as requested by the User Equipment.","When a dedicated bearer activation message is sent along with a default bearer request and an error occurs during its processing, it does not propagate to affect the establishment of the default bearer.

184,"What happens when a User Equipment (UE) moves from a 5G System (5GS) to an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network, and secondary authentication and authorization for a PDU Session were previously performed while the UE was in 5GS?","When a UE moves from 5GS to EPC after having undergone secondary authentication and authorization for a PDU Session, DN-AAA re-authorization can still be performed without requiring re-authentication signalling with the UE. This allows the SMF+PGW-C to receive new parameters from the DN-AAA Server. However, if the DN-AAA Server requests re-authentication, the SMF+PGW-C will inform the DN-AAA Server that the UE is currently unavailable for re-authentication.","In this scenario, since secondary authentication and authorization were already completed in the 5GS, there's no need for re-authentication when the UE moves to EPC. The SMF+PGW-C can still perform DN-AAA re-authorization without involving the UE in any signalling exchange. This is beneficial as it allows for seamless continuity of service without interrupting the user experience. However, if a re-authentication request is received from the DN-AAA Server, the SMF+PGW-C will respond indicating the UE's unavailability for re-authentication at that moment.","The transition from 5GS to EPC after secondary authentication and authorization for a PDU Session has implications for how re-authentication and re-authorization are handled. Specifically, while in EPC, the UE cannot be subject to re-authentication signalling due to the lack of support for such mechanisms in EPS. However, DN-AAA re-authorization can proceed without requiring direct interaction with the UE, enabling updates from the DN-AAA Server to be applied. If a re-authentication request is made by the DN-AAA Server, the SMF+PGW-C communicates the UE's current unavailability for this process, leaving further actions to be determined by the DN-AAA Server based on its policies and the response received.",3GPP TS 23.502,4.11.0a.7 Interactions with DN-AAA Server,SA WG2,"3GPP Series : 23 , Technical realization (""stage 2"")"

A third strategy entails transferring the non-3GPP PDU Sessions to E-UTRAN once the UE has transitioned into EPS, thereby ensuring continuity of service.","When executing an inter-system handover from 5GS to EPS for sessions associated with 3GPP access while a User Equipment is connected via both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, the network can adopt several strategies regarding PDU Sessions tied to the non-3GPP access. It may choose to keep these sessions active within the 5GC, allowing dual registration in EPS for 3GPP access and in 5GS for non-3GPP access. Alternatively, it might decide to release these sessions as part of the handover process, either locally or through explicit commands. Lastly, after completing the handover and establishing the UE in EPS, the network can facilitate a seamless transfer of non-3GPP PDU Sessions to E-UTRAN by triggering a PDN connection setup with a 'Handover' request type, ensuring minimal disruption to ongoing services.",3GPP TS 23.501,5.17.3 Interworking with EPC in presence of Non-3GPP PDU Sessions,SA WG2,"3GPP Series : 23 , Technical realization (""stage 2"")"

If this condition is met, it implies that node-level load information does not accurately represent the load status of individual APNs. Consequently, a PGW must advertise APN level load information if APN load control is supported and activated at the PGW.","For APN level load control to be applicable in a network, there needs to be a discrepancy in how APN resources are allocated relative to the overall capacity of different PGWs. Specifically, the ratio of configured APN resources to the total capacity of each PGW should not be uniform across all PGWs. Meeting this condition necessitates the advertisement of APN level load information by a PGW if it supports and has activated APN load control.","The applicability of APN level load control in a network hinges on the condition that there exists variability among PGWs regarding how their overall capacity is allocated to different APNs. More precisely, if the ratio of resources assigned to each APN relative to the total PGW capacity differs from one PGW to another, then APN level load control becomes relevant.

In Scheduled Resource Allocation, the UE must be in an RRC_CONNECTED state to transmit data, and NG-RAN schedules the transmission resources. In contrast, UE Autonomous Resource Selection allows the UE to transmit data regardless of its RRC state, and it autonomously selects transmission resources from a resource pool.","The two modes of resource allocation for NR sidelink communication are distinct in their requirements for RRC state and transmission resource selection. Scheduled Resource Allocation requires the UE to be in an RRC_CONNECTED state, indicating an established connection with NG-RAN, which then schedules the resources for transmission.

Additionally, the UE transitions from the ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE sub-state to the NORMAL SERVICE sub-state and sends a TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message back to the network.","The UE's actions upon receiving a TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND can be broken down into several key steps. First, it updates its internal storage by saving the received Location Area Identifier (LAI) in the SIM/USIM. Then, depending on whether the message contains an IMSI or a new TMSI, the UE either deletes any previously stored TMSI if the IMSI is recognized as belonging to the mobile station, or it stores the newly provided TMSI for future use. Furthermore, this process triggers a state transition from ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE to NORMAL SERVICE, indicating successful completion of the reallocation process. Finally, the UE acknowledges receipt and processing by sending a TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message back to the network.","When the User Equipment (UE) receives a TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND message from the network, it initiates several critical actions related to identity management and state transitions. Initially, the UE ensures that its location information is up-to-date by storing the received Location Area Identifier (LAI) in the SIM/USIM. The message's content then dictates whether the UE should delete an existing TMSI if the IMSI matches the mobile station's identity or store a new TMSI provided within the message. This process not only updates the UE's internal state but also triggers a transition from the ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE sub-state to the NORMAL SERVICE sub-state, signifying that the reallocation has been successfully processed. To complete this transaction, the UE sends a confirmation back to the network in the form of a TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message, ensuring synchronization between the UE and the network regarding identity allocations and operational states.",3GPP TS 24.008,4.3.1.2 TMSI reallocation completion by the mobile station,CT WG1,"3GPP Series : 24 , Signalling protocols (""stage 3"") - user equipment to network"

Without this context, initiation is not possible. During 5GMM procedures, the UE and the AMF suspend the transmission of 5GSM messages except in specific cases such as when 5GSM messages are piggybacked on transport or when the UE is in mode for re-establishing user-plane resources without including PDU session status.","The critical condition for initiating a 5GSM procedure is having an established 5GMM context at the UE. In its absence, the UE must first establish this context before proceeding. The impact on transmission during 5GMM procedures involves suspending 5GSM messages to prevent conflicts between session and mobility management processes. However, exceptions include scenarios where 5GSM messages are piggybacked or when re-establishing user-plane resources under specific conditions.","Essentially, a UE requires an established 5GMM context to initiate any 5GSM procedure. This prerequisite ensures that mobility and session management processes are properly aligned and do not conflict with each other. During 5GMM procedures, the general rule is to suspend the transmission of 5GSM messages to maintain process integrity.

The decision on which method to use is based on the UE's capability, specifically whether it can perform partial sensing or not, as well as the configuration of the SL mode 2 TX resource pool.","The power saving methods for a UE in Mode 2 include both periodic and aperiodic traffic handling through random resource selection. For UEs capable of partial sensing, there are two approaches: periodic-based partial sensing and contiguous partial sensing. Periodic-based partial sensing is tied to the configuration of periodic resource reservation within the resource pool, where the UE monitors specific slots during sensing occasions based on the configured periodicity.","The decision-making process for a UE in Mode 2 involves assessing its own capabilities and the allowed schemes within the configured resource pool. If capable of partial sensing, the UE can choose between periodic-based or contiguous partial sensing methods based on whether the resource pool is set up for periodic reservations or not.

When transitioning between a 5G satellite access network and a 5G terrestrial network, the mobility management involves an inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) handover, which requires coordination between different radio access technologies. In contrast, when transitioning between two different 5G satellite access networks, the mobility management involves an intra-RAT handover, which is typically less complex as it occurs within the same radio access technology.","The main distinction lies in the level of complexity and the signaling involved. When moving from a 5G satellite access network to a 5G terrestrial network (or vice versa), the mobility management needs to handle differences in network architecture, latency, and capacity, which can introduce additional complexity and signaling overhead. On the other hand, transitioning between two different 5G satellite access networks typically involves less complex procedures, as both networks share similar characteristics and capabilities.","From a practical perspective, the difference lies in the impact on user experience and network performance.

This preference for SRB2 ensures that critical information, such as IAB-DU specific F1-C related data, is transmitted over the more reliable and prioritized signaling radio bearer. By using SRB2 in this scenario, the network maintains a clear separation between control plane and user plane traffic, which is essential for efficient system clock synchronization.","The decision to use SRB2 instead of SRB1 for transmitting DLInformationTransfer messages containing only dedicatedInfoF1c hinges on the current state of the radio bearers. Specifically, if SRB2 is suspended, the network will not send this message until SRB2 is resumed.

601,What are the key differences in terms of NTN payload connectivity and potential radio link interruptions between soft and hard feeder link switchovers in a Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) scenario?,"The primary difference lies in the ability of an NTN payload to connect to multiple NTN Gateways during a given period. In a soft feeder link switchover, temporary overlap is ensured, allowing the NTN payload to maintain connectivity with more than one NTN Gateway simultaneously. This approach minimizes radio link interruptions and ensures seamless transition between feeder links. Conversely, in a hard feeder link switchover, an NTN payload connects to only one NTN Gateway at any given time, resulting in potential radio link interruptions during the transition.","From a connectivity perspective, soft feeder link switchovers enable NTN payloads to maintain concurrent connections with multiple NTN Gateways. This allows for a smoother handover process and reduces the likelihood of radio link interruptions. In contrast, hard feeder link switchovers involve a more abrupt disconnection from one NTN Gateway before reconnecting to another, increasing the risk of temporary service disruptions.","The distinction between soft and hard feeder link switchovers in an NTN scenario has significant implications for network design and performance. Soft switchovers facilitate a more robust and resilient connection, as NTN payloads can temporarily connect to multiple gateways during the transition phase. This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where maintaining continuous connectivity is critical. On the other hand, hard switchovers may be more suitable for applications with less stringent requirements on service continuity, as they involve a more straightforward disconnection and reconnection process.",3GPP TS 38.300,16.14.4.2 Assumptions,RAN2,"3GPP Series : 38 , Radio technology beyond LTE"

For Frame Structure Type 1, the primary synchronization signal is mapped to the last OFDM symbol in slots 0 and 10. In contrast, for Frame Structure Type 2, it is mapped to the third OFDM symbol in subframes 1 and 6. For Frame Structure Type 3, the mapping generally follows that of Type 1 but with specific exceptions related to transmission conditions and discovery signals. Additionally, MBMS-dedicated cells follow a modified version of Type 1's mapping rules, with transmissions occurring in slot 0 under certain subframe conditions.","The primary synchronization signal's mapping to resource elements is frame structure-dependent. In Frame Structure Type 1, it occupies the last OFDM symbol in slots 0 and 10. For Type 2, it uses the third OFDM symbol in specific subframes (1 and 6). Type 3 largely mirrors Type 1 but introduces conditions for transmission based on subframe emptiness and the number of OFDM symbols transmitted. Notably, MBMS-dedicated cells adhere to a variant of Type 1's rules, with primary synchronization signals sent in slot 0 under precise subframe criteria.","The mapping of the primary synchronization signal sequence to resource elements in E-UTRA is tailored to each frame structure type to optimize performance and minimize interference. Frame Structure Type 1 places the signal at the end of slots 0 and 10, while Type 2 positions it within specific subframes (1 and 6) on the third OFDM symbol.

The absence of such an indication leads the SMF to assume that PDU Set based handling is unsupported by the target node, prompting it to follow guidelines for further actions.","In scenarios where a handover occurs from a gNB not supporting PDU Set based handling to one that does, the target gNB employs distinct signaling mechanisms to convey its support for this feature to the SMF. Specifically, it leverages either the Path Switch Request or Handover Resource Allocation procedures, contingent upon whether an Xn or NG handover is in progress. The omission of this indication triggers the SMF to deduce a lack of PDU Set based handling support by the target gNB, subsequently prompting adherence to operational directives for managing such situations.",3GPP TS 38.300,16.15.5 Non-Homogeneous support of PDU set based handling in NG-RAN,RAN2,"3GPP Series : 38 , Radio technology beyond LTE"

931,"What are the three types of PSCell change failures that can occur in a multi-connectivity scenario, and how do they relate to the timing and outcome of the PSCell change procedure?","In a multi-connectivity scenario, there are three primary types of PSCell change failures. Firstly, Too late PSCell change occurs when an SCG failure happens after the UE has stayed in the PSCell for an extended period, despite a more suitable PSCell being available based on UE measurements. Secondly, Too early PSCell change happens when an SCG failure occurs shortly after a successful PSCell change or during the procedure itself, indicating that the source PSCell was still the most suitable option according to UE measurements. Lastly, Triggering PSCell change to wrong PSCell involves an SCG failure occurring shortly after a successful PSCell change or during the procedure, with a different, more suitable PSCell being identified based on UE measurements.","The three types of PSCell change failures in multi-connectivity scenarios are closely tied to the timing and outcome of the PSCell change procedure. Too late PSCell change signifies a missed opportunity for a timely switch, leading to prolonged suboptimal performance. In contrast, Too early PSCell change suggests premature switching, which might be due to incorrect assessment or instability in measurements. The third type, Triggering PSCell change to wrong PSCell, indicates an error in the decision-making process, possibly due to outdated information or misinterpretation of UE reports.","From a network optimization perspective, understanding the three types of PSCell change failures is crucial for improving multi-connectivity performance. Too late PSCell change failures can be mitigated by enhancing the sensitivity and responsiveness of the PSCell change mechanism to UE measurements, ensuring that switches are made in a timely manner. For Too early PSCell change, refining the criteria for initiating a switch and incorporating more robust stability checks can help prevent premature changes. Addressing Triggering PSCell change to wrong PSCell failures involves improving the accuracy of the decision-making process through better data analysis and possibly integrating additional inputs from other network elements.",3GPP TS 37.340,10.18.2 PSCell change failure,RAN2,"3GPP Series : 37 , Multiple radio access technology aspects"

In case of an intersystem change, the network distinguishes between two scenarios: if the target Radio Network Controller (RNC) is controlled by the same SGSN, the existing cipher and integrity keys are sent directly to the RNC; otherwise, the initial SGSN forwards these keys to the new SGSN controlling the target RNC, which then stores and sends them to the RNC. The UE applies the received cipher and integrity keys for secure communication.","For a UMTS security context to be established, the UE must have an ME that supports UMTS AKA and be connected to a Release 99 or later version of a VLR/SGSN. When an intersystem change occurs, the network handles it differently based on whether the target RNC is controlled by the same SGSN or not. If it's the same SGSN, the existing cipher and integrity keys are directly sent to the new RNC; if it's a different SGSN, these keys are forwarded from the initial SGSN to the new one, which then becomes the anchor point for the service and handles key distribution to the target RNC. This ensures seamless security context maintenance across network changes.","The establishment of a UMTS security context requires that the UE's ME is capable of UMTS AKA and connected to a Release 99 or later VLR/SGSN. When an intersystem change happens, involving a move to a different RNC possibly under another SGSN, the network ensures continuity of the security context through key management. If the target RNC remains under the same SGSN's control, existing cipher and integrity keys are reused by sending them directly to the new RNC; if the change involves moving to an RNC under a different SGSN, these keys are securely forwarded from the initial SGSN to the new one, which assumes responsibility for key management and distribution to the target RNC.

Firstly, the UE must be configured to use Access Classes (AC) 11-15 in the selected Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN). Alternatively, the UE should have a Packet Data Network (PDN) connection established for emergency bearer services. Lastly, if the UE is configured for dual priority and has a PDN connection without low access priority, but Timer T3346 was started due to NAS signalling with low access priority, it can also send the UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message.","The conditions under which a UE can send an UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message while Timer T3346 is running are primarily based on its configuration and existing PDN connections.

These include the current network load, UE mobility patterns, and the availability of resources at both gNBs. Once the decision is made, the transfer of affected UE context between the two gNBs is facilitated through either NG-based or Xn-based handover procedures.

Firstly, it can act as a PPP terminator, where it terminates the PPP connection towards the Mobile Station (MS). This means that the GGSN is responsible for handling and processing PPP frames directly, without forwarding them to the external PDN. Secondly, the GGSN can also tunnel PPP frames to the PDN, in which case it may behave like a L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) towards the external network.","A GGSN's role significantly influences how PPP frames are handled. If the GGSN terminates PPP, it essentially becomes the endpoint of the PPP connection from the MS. This termination point is crucial as it allows for direct interaction between the GGSN and the MS, facilitating control over data transmission and reception. On the other hand, if the GGSN tunnels PPP frames to the PDN, it adopts a more relay-oriented role.","The roles of a GGSN in interworking with an ISP/PDN have profound implications on PPP frame handling.

If a grant and a MAC PDU are received for the current subframe, it delivers both to the corresponding Sidelink process and instructs it to initiate a new transmission. Conversely, if no grant or MAC PDU is available but the subframe aligns with a retransmission opportunity for an existing Sidelink process, the entity directs that process to perform a retransmission.","For each subframe of SL-DCH, the Sidelink HARQ Entity checks two conditions. First, if it has received both a grant and a MAC PDU for transmission in that subframe, it proceeds by delivering these to the appropriate Sidelink process and commands this process to start a new transmission cycle. Second, if neither a grant nor a MAC PDU is present but the timing matches a scheduled retransmission for an ongoing Sidelink communication, the entity instructs the relevant process to execute a retransmission.","The Sidelink HARQ Entity at the MAC entity plays a crucial role in managing transmissions on SL-DCH by dynamically responding to two primary scenarios within each subframe. When equipped with both a transmission grant and a MAC PDU for that specific subframe, it not only forwards these critical components to their designated Sidelink process but also triggers the initiation of a fresh transmission cycle.

The choice between these modes depends on the specific requirements of the application or service being supported. UM is typically used for applications that require low latency and can tolerate some packet loss, such as real-time video streaming. On the other hand, AM provides reliable data transfer with error detection and correction, making it suitable for applications that require guaranteed delivery, such as file transfers.","The RLC transmission modes supported for DRBs in a 5G New Radio network are UM and AM. These modes have different implications for the performance of the network. UM is optimized for low-latency and high-throughput applications, but it does not guarantee reliable data transfer. In contrast, AM provides guaranteed delivery with error detection and correction, but this comes at the cost of increased latency due to the additional overhead of acknowledgments and retransmissions.","The choice of RLC transmission mode for DRBs in a 5G New Radio network has implications for network design and optimization.

This implies that the UE wants to cancel the ongoing process of establishing an MM connection, which would normally lead to the setup of a dedicated channel for data transmission. As a result, the expected outcome is that the MM connection establishment will be terminated, and the Radio Resource (RR) connection, which was allocated for this purpose, will also be released.","When a UE sends a CM SERVICE ABORT message to the network, it is essentially signaling its intention to abort the current MM connection setup process. This could be due to various reasons such as loss of coverage, user intervention, or failure in authentication. The expected outcome of this action is twofold. Firstly, the ongoing MM connection establishment will be aborted, meaning that no further attempts will be made to establish a dedicated channel for data transmission. Secondly, the RR connection, which was allocated for this purpose, will also be released back to the network, making it available for other users or services.","The CM SERVICE ABORT message sent by a UE to the network serves as a request to terminate the current MM connection establishment process and release any associated radio resources. This action is typically taken when the UE determines that it can no longer proceed with the connection setup, perhaps due to changes in its mobility state or failure in authentication.

Secondly, if a new TAI list was included in the preceding GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the MME treats this new list as the valid TAI list and marks the previous one as invalid.","The receipt of the GUTI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message by the MME triggers two key validity updates. It causes the MME to invalidate the old GUTI, which was previously used for identifying the User Equipment in the network, and instead consider the newly allocated GUTI as valid for future communications.

This action indicates to the network that the UE cannot process the received message due to its unrecognized or unsupported nature. In contrast, if the UE receives a message incompatible with its current protocol state, it should also return a status message but with cause #98 'message type not compatible with protocol state', highlighting the difference in handling based on whether the issue is with the message's existence/implementation or its compatibility with the UE's current operational state.","The User Equipment (UE) takes distinct actions based on whether it receives an EPS message that is non-existent/not implemented for the given Protocol Discriminator versus one that is incompatible with its protocol state. For a message type not defined or implemented, the UE responds with a status message and cause #97, signaling to the network that the message cannot be processed due to its unrecognized nature. This response helps in maintaining protocol integrity by acknowledging the limitation. On the other hand, if the UE encounters a message incompatible with its current state, it returns a similar status message but with cause #98, indicating a mismatch between the received message and the UE's operational context.","Upon receiving an EPS message with a non-existent or not implemented message type for the given Protocol Discriminator, the User Equipment (UE) initiates a response to notify the network about the unrecognizable message. This is achieved by sending back a status message—either EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS—with cause #97 'message type non-existent or not implemented'. The UE's behavior in this scenario underscores its adherence to protocol specifications and its inability to process messages outside its recognized set.

This means that in a non-contiguous transmission scenario using Frame Structure Type 3, the UE transmitter must be able to set its initial output power to a specific value for the first sub-frame at the start of the transmission, provided the gap between transmissions is greater than 40 ms.","In a non-contiguous transmission scenario with Frame Structure Type 3, the minimum transmission gap duration required for the absolute power tolerance requirements to apply is indeed 40 ms. However, when SRS carrier based switching is used, this requirement changes such that the transmission gaps on component carriers (to which SRS switching occurs) must be larger than 40 ms for the absolute power tolerance requirements to apply.","The key takeaway here is that Frame Structure Type 3 has a specific requirement of a minimum 40 ms transmission gap duration for the absolute power tolerance requirements to apply in non-contiguous transmissions.

How should its peer handle this element upon reception?","A node is required to include the Recovery information element in a Tunnel Management Message under two specific conditions. Firstly, if it's the initial contact between the node and its peer, or secondly, if either the node or its peer has recently restarted but hasn't yet shared the new Restart Counter value with each other. Not including this element in these scenarios may lead to synchronization issues and potential disruptions in tunnel management. Upon receiving this element, the peer should process it similarly to how an Echo Response message is handled.","For a node to include the Recovery information element in a Tunnel Management Message, two key scenarios must occur. The first scenario involves the initial communication between the node and its peer, necessitating the inclusion of this element for synchronization purposes. This ensures that both parties are aware of each other's status and can establish a reliable connection. The second scenario arises when there's been a restart either at the node or its peer end, but before the new Restart Counter value has been communicated to the other party. In this case, not including the Recovery information element may lead to inconsistencies in tunnel management, potentially causing errors or data loss. When a peer receives this Recovery information element, it should treat it with the same protocol as an Echo Response message.","The inclusion of the Recovery information element by a node in a Tunnel Management Message is contingent upon two primary conditions. Firstly, during the inaugural interaction between the node and its peer, this element must be included to facilitate a synchronized start-up process. This ensures operational continuity and prevents potential disruptions in tunnel management. Secondly, in scenarios where either the node or its peer undergoes a restart but fails to communicate the updated Restart Counter value, inclusion of this element becomes necessary for maintaining operational continuity.

By sharing this information, UEs can negotiate and agree on a common DRX configuration, which helps to minimize interference, reduce power consumption, and improve overall system performance.",3GPP TS 38.331,5.8.9.6 Sidelink UE assistance information 5.8.9.6.1 General,RAN2,"3GPP Series : 38 , Radio technology beyond LTE"
1997,What is the minimum throughput requirement for ProSe Direct Discovery and Communication as a percentage of the maximum throughput?,"The minimum throughput requirement for ProSe Direct Discovery and Communication is at least 95% of the maximum throughput, ensuring devices supporting ProSe can maintain reliable communication while minimizing interference.","To guarantee efficient operation, the UE must achieve a throughput of ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput for both ProSe Direct Discovery and Communication, crucial in ensuring seamless connectivity and data exchange between nearby devices.",The specified minimum throughput of 95% for ProSe Direct Discovery and Communication ensures that UEs can effectively utilize the available bandwidth while maintaining optimal network performance and user experience.,3GPP TS 36.101,7.7.1D Minimum requirements for ProSe,RAN4,"3GPP Series : 36 , LTE (Evolved UTRA), LTE-Advanced, LTE-Advanced Pro radio technology"
1998,"What is the primary responsibility of the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) in the context of Network-Controlled Repeater management, and how does it interact with the gNB to facilitate this process?","The AMF's primary responsibility in Network-Controlled Repeater management is to provide authorization information for the repeater. This involves verifying the repeater's identity and ensuring that it has permission to operate within the network. To facilitate this process, the AMF interacts with the gNB by receiving a request from the gNB to authorize the repeater and then sending back the necessary authorization information.","The primary role of the AMF in Network-Controlled Repeater management is to act as an intermediary between the gNB and the repeater, ensuring that only authorized repeaters are allowed to access the network. When a repeater attempts to connect to the network, the gNB sends a request to the AMF for authorization. The AMF then verifies the repeater's credentials and responds back to the gNB with the necessary authorization information, which is used by the gNB to grant or deny access to the repeater.","In the context of Network-Controlled Repeater management, the AMF plays a crucial role in ensuring that only legitimate repeaters are allowed to operate within the network. The AMF's primary responsibility is to provide authentication and authorization services for the repeater. When a gNB receives a request from a repeater to access the network, it forwards this request to the AMF, which then verifies the repeater's identity and checks its permissions. If the repeater is authorized, the AMF sends back an acknowledgement to the gNB, which can then grant access to the repeater.",3GPP TS 38.300,4.9.5 Network-controlled repeater management,RAN2,"3GPP Series : 38 , Radio technology beyond LTE"
1999,"What is the purpose of the EAP message information element in the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System, and what are its minimum and maximum length requirements?","The primary function of the EAP message information element is to facilitate the transportation of an EAP message. This element has a specific coding structure, with a minimum length requirement of 7 octets and a maximum length of 1503 octets.","The EAP message information element serves as a container to carry EAP messages in the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System. It is designed with flexibility in mind, having a variable length that ranges from a minimum of 7 octets to a maximum of 1503 octets.","In the context of the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System, the EAP message information element plays a crucial role in transporting EAP messages.
