5,"What are the primary mechanisms used to ensure reliable packet delivery in E-UTRAN, and how do they interact to minimize packet errors and delay?","The primary mechanisms for ensuring reliable packet delivery in E-UTRAN are HARQ retransmissions at the MAC layer and ARQ mechanism of RLC. HARQ takes care of retransmitting packets up to a maximum configurable number if they fail to deliver. If all HARQ retransmissions fail, RLC's ARQ mechanism steps in to correct any residual packet errors.","To ensure reliable packet delivery with minimal errors and delay in E-UTRAN, the network employs a two-layered approach. At the MAC layer, HARQ retransmissions are utilized to correct most packet errors promptly. For those packets that still fail after multiple HARQ attempts and when RLC operates in acknowledged mode, the ARQ mechanism at the RLC layer provides an additional safety net to rectify any remaining errors.","The interaction between HARQ and ARQ mechanisms is crucial for achieving reliable packet delivery in E-UTRAN. By configuring RLC to operate in acknowledged mode for specific applications that demand ultra-low packet loss rates, the network ensures that even if HARQ retransmissions at the MAC layer fail to deliver a packet, the ARQ mechanism can still recover it.",3GPP TS 32.425,A.8 Monitor of ARQ and HARQ performance,SA WG5,"3GPP Series : 32 , OAM&P and Charging"

This allows the UE to connect to APNs that are not explicitly listed in its subscription context.","In this scenario, the presence of a wild card APN in the UE's subscription context grants it permission to connect to any APN, even if it is not specified in the subscription context. As a result, when the UE requests to register a PDN GW ID with an unknown APN, the network nodes will create a new entry for this APN-PDN GW ID relation and store it for future reference.","The wild card APN acts as a catch-all mechanism, enabling the UE to establish connections with various APNs not explicitly defined in its subscription profile. When the UE attempts to register a PDN GW ID with an unfamiliar APN, the network entities will dynamically create and store this new APN-PDN GW ID association, effectively expanding the UE's connectivity options beyond its predefined subscription context.",3GPP TS 23.401,5.7.6 Handling of Wild Card APN,SA WG2,"3GPP Series : 23 , Technical realization (""stage 2"")"
8,"When the User Equipment (UE) does not provide an Access Point Name (APN) for a PDP context activation, which APN does the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) use as the congested APN during APN-based congestion control?",The SGSN utilizes the APN that was used in the GGSN/PDN GW selection procedure as the congested APN. This approach ensures a standardized method of handling congestion control when specific APN information is not provided by the UE.,"The SGSN resorts to using the APN from the GGSN/PDN GW selection process as the basis for determining the congested APN. This decision-making process allows the network to manage and mitigate congestion effectively, even in situations where the UE does not explicitly indicate an APN during PDP context activation.","When a UE fails to provide an APN during the activation of a PDP context, the SGSN defaults to using the APN that was previously utilized for the GGSN/PDN GW selection procedure. This default behavior enables the network to implement congestion control measures based on the available APN information, thereby ensuring efficient management of network resources and preventing potential bottlenecks.",3GPP TS 24.008,6.1.3.11 Handling of APN based congestion control,CT WG1,"3GPP Series : 24 , Signalling protocols (""stage 3"") - user equipment to network"

28,"What happens when a User Equipment (UE) receives an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for an already activated default EPS bearer context, and how does it manage its EPS bearer contexts to prevent conflicts and ensure service continuity?","When a UE receives such a request, it locally deactivates the existing default EPS bearer context that matches the EPS bearer identity in the received message. This is done to prevent duplication and potential mismanagement of EPS bearer contexts. Additionally, all associated dedicated EPS bearer contexts are also deactivated to maintain consistency and prevent potential errors. Following this, the UE proceeds with the activation of the requested dedicated EPS bearer context.","In such a scenario, the UE takes corrective action to manage its EPS bearer contexts efficiently. It first deactivates the existing default EPS bearer context that matches the EPS bearer identity in the received message.

When an MS receives signals from two cells using the same BCCH frequency, the BSIC helps to distinguish between these cells. Specifically, the three least significant bits of the BSIC, known as the BCC, indicate which training sequence is used in the bursts sent on the downlink common channels of the cell. This allows for better transmission and reduces interference.","The BSIC helps avoid ambiguity or interference in a cellular network by enabling the MS to identify the cell it is communicating with, even when multiple cells use the same BCCH frequency.

200,"What is the primary purpose of a User Equipment sending a CM SERVICE ABORT message to the network, and what are the expected outcomes for the ongoing MM connection establishment and RR connection?","The primary purpose of a User Equipment (UE) sending a CM SERVICE ABORT message to the network is to request the abortion of the first Mobility Management (MM) connection establishment in progress. This implies that the UE wants to cancel the ongoing process of establishing an MM connection, which would normally lead to the setup of a dedicated channel for data transmission. As a result, the expected outcome is that the MM connection establishment will be terminated, and the Radio Resource (RR) connection, which was allocated for this purpose, will also be released.","When a UE sends a CM SERVICE ABORT message to the network, it is essentially signaling its intention to abort the current MM connection setup process. This could be due to various reasons such as loss of coverage, user intervention, or failure in authentication. The expected outcome of this action is twofold. Firstly, the ongoing MM connection establishment will be aborted, meaning that no further attempts will be made to establish a dedicated channel for data transmission. Secondly, the RR connection, which was allocated for this purpose, will also be released back to the network, making it available for other users or services.","The CM SERVICE ABORT message sent by a UE to the network serves as a request to terminate the current MM connection establishment process and release any associated radio resources. This action is typically taken when the UE determines that it can no longer proceed with the connection setup, perhaps due to changes in its mobility state or failure in authentication. The expected outcome of this message is that the network will acknowledge the abortion request and take necessary steps to terminate the MM connection establishment process. Additionally, any allocated RR connections will be released, allowing the UE to enter a state where it can re-initiate an MM connection setup if needed.",3GPP TS 24.008,9.2.7 CM service abort,CT WG1,"3GPP Series : 24 , Signalling protocols (""stage 3"") - user equipment to network"

If the UE is in the CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF can fulfill the request directly by responding to the consumer NF with the result indication. However, if the UE is in the CM-IDLE state, the AMF initiates paging procedures to prompt the UE to transition into the CM-CONNECTED state, after which it responds to the consumer NF.

Please provide details on the mechanisms used to achieve this.","The 5G system ensures service continuity by employing several mechanisms that minimize packet loss and interruption time. One such mechanism is the use of IP anchoring points, which allow the UE to maintain its IP address even when moving across different cells and access technologies. This approach reduces the impact on user experience and maintains the quality of service (QoS). Additionally, the 5G system uses techniques like packet buffering and forwarding to minimize packet loss during handovers.","To ensure service continuity during inter- and intra-access technology mobility, the 5G system utilizes a combination of network-based and UE-based solutions. For instance, the 5G system supports maintaining the IP address assigned to a UE through mechanisms like IP address preservation.

Firstly, it enhances security by making the data more resistant to eavesdropping or unauthorized decoding. Additionally, this process aids in ensuring that PDCCHs start at their designated positions, thereby maintaining proper alignment and facilitating efficient decoding by intended receivers. However, one of the challenges is ensuring that the scrambling sequence generator is properly initialized with the cell-specific identity at the start of each subframe.","Scrambling a block of bits with a cell-specific sequence before modulation in PDCCH multiplexing has both technical and practical implications. From a technical standpoint, it ensures that the length of the scrambled block matches the available resource-element groups not assigned to other control channels, thus optimizing resource utilization. Practically, this process supports the multiplexing of multiple control channels without conflicts or inefficiencies, allowing for more efficient use of resources within the subframe.","The cell-specific sequence used in PDCCH multiplexing and scrambling plays a crucial role in ensuring both security and proper formatting of the transmitted control information. By scrambling the block of bits with this sequence prior to modulation, the system ensures that only authorized receivers can correctly decode the data after descrambling it with their knowledge of the cell's specific sequence.

In a soft feeder link switchover, temporary overlap is ensured, allowing the NTN payload to maintain connectivity with more than one NTN Gateway simultaneously. This approach minimizes radio link interruptions and ensures seamless transition between feeder links. Conversely, in a hard feeder link switchover, an NTN payload connects to only one NTN Gateway at any given time, resulting in potential radio link interruptions during the transition.","From a connectivity perspective, soft feeder link switchovers enable NTN payloads to maintain concurrent connections with multiple NTN Gateways. This allows for a smoother handover process and reduces the likelihood of radio link interruptions. In contrast, hard feeder link switchovers involve a more abrupt disconnection from one NTN Gateway before reconnecting to another, increasing the risk of temporary service disruptions.","The distinction between soft and hard feeder link switchovers in an NTN scenario has significant implications for network design and performance. Soft switchovers facilitate a more robust and resilient connection, as NTN payloads can temporarily connect to multiple gateways during the transition phase.

For stationary UEs, the network can use fixed IP addresses or static routing to maintain connectivity. For nomadic UEs, the network can employ techniques like IP address anchoring or tunneling to ensure continuous service delivery as the UE moves between activations. Fully mobile UEs are supported through advanced handover mechanisms and optimized routing protocols that minimize interruption time and reduce latency.","To ensure seamless mobility for UEs with diverse mobility needs, the 5G network utilizes a flexible architecture that accommodates various mobility management approaches. For instance, some applications may require the network to maintain seamless mobility by hiding UE movement from the application layer, thereby preventing service interruptions. In contrast, other applications might employ their own mechanisms for ensuring service continuity but still rely on the network to minimize interruption time. The 5G system supports both scenarios by providing a range of mobility management options that can be tailored to specific use cases.","The 5G network ensures seamless mobility and minimizes interruption time for UEs with varying mobility needs through several key features. Firstly, the network supports IP traffic offloading onto traditional IP routing networks via an IP anchor node close to the network edge. This approach enables efficient handling of multimedia broadband data volumes while reducing latency and improving user experience. Secondly, the 5G system allows for flexible mobility management methods that can be adapted to different types of UEs, such as stationary sensors or fully mobile devices.

The first mode involves the UE generating HARQ-ACK information with an ACK value upon successful decoding of a transport block or detection of a DCI format indicating an SPS PDSCH release. Conversely, it generates NACK for unsuccessful decodings. This mode ensures that the network receives explicit feedback on both successful and failed receptions. The second mode differs significantly as the UE does not transmit any HARQ-ACK information with ACK values via PUCCH, essentially limiting the feedback to only instances of failure or specific conditions indicated by higher layer configurations.","For MBS in a 5G NR network, two HARQ-ACK reporting modes are specified. The primary difference between these modes lies in how and when the UE sends HARQ-ACK feedback. In the first mode, the UE is required to send ACK or NACK based on whether it correctly decodes a transport block or detects specific DCI formats. This provides comprehensive feedback to the network about the success of multicast transmissions. The second mode simplifies this by not requiring the UE to send ACK feedback via PUCCH for successful receptions, focusing instead on scenarios where higher layers have specifically enabled HARQ feedback or indicated through DCI scheduling.","Within the context of MBS in 5G NR networks, two HARQ-ACK reporting modes are outlined to cater to different operational requirements. The first mode mandates that UEs provide detailed feedback by generating ACK for successful decoding or detection of specific DCI formats and NACK otherwise. This ensures the network has a clear understanding of transmission outcomes. In contrast, the second mode adopts a more selective approach where UEs do not transmit ACK feedback under normal circumstances but may still send HARQ-ACK information based on higher layer configurations or specific indications in the DCI scheduling for multicast transmissions.",3GPP TS 38.300,16.10.5.7 Physical Layer,RAN2,"3GPP Series : 38 , Radio technology beyond LTE"

In Scheduled Resource Allocation, the UE must be in an RRC_CONNECTED state to transmit data, and NG-RAN schedules the transmission resources. In contrast, UE Autonomous Resource Selection allows the UE to transmit data regardless of its RRC state, and it autonomously selects transmission resources from a resource pool.","The two modes of resource allocation for NR sidelink communication are distinct in their requirements for RRC state and transmission resource selection. Scheduled Resource Allocation requires the UE to be in an RRC_CONNECTED state, indicating an established connection with NG-RAN, which then schedules the resources for transmission. This mode ensures that transmissions are coordinated and managed by the network. On the other hand, UE Autonomous Resource Selection offers more flexibility as it allows the UE to transmit data without needing to be in a specific RRC state, thus enabling communication even outside of NG-RAN coverage or when the UE is not actively connected.","The primary difference between Scheduled Resource Allocation and UE Autonomous Resource Selection for NR sidelink communication lies in how transmission resources are allocated and managed. In Scheduled Resource Allocation, NG-RAN plays an active role by scheduling resources for the UE, necessitating that the UE be in an RRC_CONNECTED state to receive these allocations. This approach is beneficial for scenarios where network coordination is crucial. Conversely, UE Autonomous Resource Selection empowers the UE to independently select transmission resources from predefined pools, making it suitable for situations where UEs need to communicate without direct network oversight, such as in public safety or IoT applications.",3GPP TS 38.300,16.9.3 Radio Resource Allocation 16.9.3.1 General,RAN2,"3GPP Series : 38 , Radio technology beyond LTE"

643,"What happens when a User Equipment (UE) receives a NAS message without integrity protection after NAS integrity has been activated, and what is the impact on replay protection in this scenario?","When a UE receives a NAS message without integrity protection after NAS integrity has been activated, it will not accept the message. This is because once NAS integrity is activated, both the UE and the AMF only accept NAS messages with integrity protection. The activation of NAS integrity implies that replay protection is also active, ensuring each incoming NAS COUNT value is accepted only once using the same NAS security context.","Upon receiving a NAS message without integrity protection after NAS integrity activation, the UE will reject it to maintain the security of the communication. This rejection is crucial because accepting such messages could compromise the integrity of the data exchange between the UE and the network. The simultaneous activation of replay protection ensures that even if an attacker attempts to intercept and retransmit a valid message (a replay attack), the receiver can identify and reject it due to the duplicate NAS COUNT value, thereby safeguarding against potential security breaches.","When a UE receives a NAS message without integrity protection after the activation of NAS integrity, it will discard the message. This strict adherence to only accepting protected messages is essential for preventing man-in-the-middle attacks or data tampering. The activation of replay protection in conjunction with NAS integrity ensures that each message is uniquely identified and can be verified as not having been previously received, thus protecting against replay attacks.",3GPP TS 33.501,6.4.3.2 NAS integrity activation,SA WG3,"3GPP Series : 33 , Security aspects"

This uniqueness prevents keystream re-use during AKA re-synchronisations, thereby enhancing security. By including MAC-S in the calculation of AUTS, any attempt to replay an authentication challenge will result in a different AK being calculated due to the changed input, thus protecting SQNMS values from potential leakage.","The inclusion of MAC-S as an additional input to the f5* function introduces variability that is dependent on both RAND and MAC-S. This means that even if an attacker manages to obtain or replay a previous authentication challenge, the resulting AK will be different due to the unique value of MAC-S used in each re-synchronisation attempt. Consequently, this modification effectively prevents keystream re-use by ensuring that the encryption keys used for protecting SQNMS values are always distinct.","By incorporating MAC-S into the modified f5* function, operators can significantly mitigate the risk of keystream re-use during AKA re-synchronisations. This is because the inclusion of MAC-S as an input ensures that the AK calculation is not solely dependent on RAND, which could otherwise lead to keystream reuse if RAND values are repeated or compromised.

747,"Describe the key steps involved in the multicast service deactivation procedure, including the roles of UE, GGSN, BM-SC, and SGSN, and explain how this process ensures efficient resource management in the network.","The multicast service deactivation procedure involves several critical steps. First, the User Equipment (UE) sends an IGMP or MLD Leave message to indicate its intention to leave a specific MBMS multicast service identified by an IP multicast address. This triggers the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) to send a Session Termination Request to the Broadcast Multicast Service Centre (BM-SC), which then verifies the IP multicast address and sends a Session Termination Acknowledgement back to the GGSN. The GGSN subsequently sends an MBMS UE Context Deactivation Request to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN), leading to the deletion of the MBMS UE Context. Finally, the GGSN confirms the successful deactivation by sending another Session Termination Request to the BM-SC.","From a network perspective, the multicast service deactivation procedure is crucial for efficient resource management. The process begins with the UE's Leave message, which prompts the GGSN to initiate the deactivation sequence. This involves communicating with the BM-SC to verify the multicast service details and obtain confirmation before proceeding with the deletion of the MBMS UE Context at the SGSN. Notably, if no other users are interested in the specific MBMS bearer service, the GGSN may also trigger a De-Registration procedure as part of this process.","A detailed examination of the multicast service deactivation procedure reveals several critical steps that ensure seamless and efficient termination of user registration to an MBMS multicast service. Initially, the UE's Leave message sets off a chain of events involving the GGSN, BM-SC, and SGSN.

Enforcement mechanisms include credit control processes that monitor and limit energy usage based on these predefined policies, ensuring adherence to the set energy consumption caps. Additionally, the system provides a means to modify communication services based on energy-related information criteria, allowing for more efficient use of network resources.","To support subscription policies with maximum energy credit limits for non-QoS services, the 5G system utilizes a comprehensive approach that involves multiple components. It allows operators to define detailed subscription policies that include maximum energy consumption thresholds, which can be based on regulatory requirements or operator-specific needs. The system integrates mechanisms to track and associate energy consumption with charging information, enabling real-time monitoring against these policy-defined limits. Through advanced credit control mechanisms, the system enforces these policies by comparing actual energy usage against allocated credits, thereby preventing excessive energy consumption beyond the set limits for services without QoS criteria.",3GPP TS 22.261,6.15a.2.2 Requirements,SA WG1,"3GPP Series : 22 , Service aspects (""stage 1"")"

Additionally, if timer T312 is running for that SpCell, it also gets stopped. This action implies that the UE maintains its RRC connection without any explicit signaling, effectively preserving the entire radio resource configuration.","When a UE receives N311 consecutive 'in-sync' indications from lower layers for a Secondary Cell while timer T310 is active, it takes two immediate actions: first, it stops timer T310 associated with that SpCell. Second, if another timer, T312, is running for the same SpCell, it also gets halted. The significance of these actions lies in their impact on the Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection. By stopping these timers and not taking any further action, the UE effectively maintains its current RRC connection state without needing to signal any changes or updates.","Receiving N311 consecutive 'in-sync' indications for a Secondary Cell from lower layers while timer T310 is running triggers specific actions in the User Equipment (UE). The UE responds by stopping two timers: T310, which is directly associated with this condition, and T312 if it's currently running for that SpCell. A critical implication of these actions is the preservation of the RRC connection state.

Provide an example of a specific use case where this procedure would be beneficial.","The locking shift procedure allows for dynamic switching between different codesets during message content analysis. Its primary purpose is to enable more efficient use of codesets by shifting to higher-order codesets as needed. When a locking shift information element is encountered, it indicates that subsequent information elements should be interpreted according to the new active codeset. This means that the identifiers and formats defined in the new codeset will be used until another locking shift information element is encountered or the message content analysis is completed. A practical example of this would be in a scenario where a message contains both standard and specialized elements, each requiring different codesets for proper interpretation.","The locking shift procedure serves as a temporary override mechanism for the default codeset, allowing it to be replaced with a higher-order codeset. This override is valid only within the scope of the current message and does not affect subsequent messages. In real-world telecom networks, this procedure is particularly useful when dealing with messages that contain elements requiring different codesets for proper interpretation.

1039,"What are the conditions under which a UMTS security context is established for a User Equipment (UE) with a Mobile Equipment (ME) capable of UMTS Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA), and how does the network handle intersystem changes to different Serving GPRS Support Nodes (SGSNs)?","A UMTS security context is established when a UE with an ME capable of UMTS AKA connects to a Release 99 or later version of a Visitor Location Register/SGSN. In case of an intersystem change, the network distinguishes between two scenarios: if the target Radio Network Controller (RNC) is controlled by the same SGSN, the existing cipher and integrity keys are sent directly to the RNC; otherwise, the initial SGSN forwards these keys to the new SGSN controlling the target RNC, which then stores and sends them to the RNC. The UE applies the received cipher and integrity keys for secure communication.","For a UMTS security context to be established, the UE must have an ME that supports UMTS AKA and be connected to a Release 99 or later version of a VLR/SGSN. When an intersystem change occurs, the network handles it differently based on whether the target RNC is controlled by the same SGSN or not. If it's the same SGSN, the existing cipher and integrity keys are directly sent to the new RNC; if it's a different SGSN, these keys are forwarded from the initial SGSN to the new one, which then becomes the anchor point for the service and handles key distribution to the target RNC. This ensures seamless security context maintenance across network changes.","The establishment of a UMTS security context requires that the UE's ME is capable of UMTS AKA and connected to a Release 99 or later VLR/SGSN. When an intersystem change happens, involving a move to a different RNC possibly under another SGSN, the network ensures continuity of the security context through key management. If the target RNC remains under the same SGSN's control, existing cipher and integrity keys are reused by sending them directly to the new RNC; if the change involves moving to an RNC under a different SGSN, these keys are securely forwarded from the initial SGSN to the new one, which assumes responsibility for key management and distribution to the target RNC. This process ensures that the UE can maintain secure communication across network changes without interruption.",3GPP TS 33.102,6.8.7.1 UMTS security context,SA WG3,"3GPP Series : 33 , Security aspects"

If the UE is considered reachable, this calculation triggers the AMF to send an N2 RAN Paging Request message to the NG-RAN.","When mobile terminated data or signaling arrives for a UE in RRC_INACTIVE state, the other Network Functions (NFs), such as the Session Management Function (SMF) and User Plane Function (UPF), communicate with the AMF for delivery of MT data or signaling. The AMF then determines that the UE has become reachable for paging based on the stored information, eDRX values for RRC_INACTIVE, and downlink data size information provided by UPF/SMF, triggering it to send an N2 RAN Paging Request message.","The trigger for the AMF to send an N2 RAN Paging Request message is when the NG-RAN had previously sent an indication for the Core Network (CN) to handle mobile terminated communication and the UE resumes the RRC connection, indicating that it is now reachable for downlink data and/or signaling.

1223,"What are the key differences between periodical and event-triggered reporting configurations in the LoggedMeasurementConfiguration message used for network performance optimization in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE states, and how do these configurations impact the logging of measurement results by the User Equipment?","The primary difference between periodical and event-triggered reporting configurations lies in their triggering mechanisms. Periodical reporting is configured using a parameter that dictates the regular interval at which measurements are logged and reported. In contrast, event-triggered reporting is configured where an event triggers the logging of measurements based on specific conditions like threshold crossings or hysteresis levels. This difference significantly impacts how User Equipment logs measurement results; periodical reporting ensures consistent, time-based logging useful for general network performance monitoring, while event-triggered reporting allows for more dynamic and condition-based logging that can capture critical network events.","The LoggedMeasurementConfiguration message supports two distinct reporting configurations - periodical and event-triggered. Periodical reporting involves the periodic transmission of logged measurements at fixed intervals, which is beneficial for continuous monitoring of network performance over time. On the other hand, event-triggered reporting allows for more flexible logging based on specific events or conditions such as coverage loss or signal strength thresholds. This flexibility in event-triggered reporting enables targeted logging that can be tailored to capture critical network behaviors or anomalies without the need for constant periodic reports.","From a practical perspective, the key difference between periodical and event-triggered reporting is their application in optimizing network performance. Periodical reporting provides a baseline for regular monitoring by logging measurements at consistent intervals, which can help identify long-term trends or issues in network coverage and quality.

Initially, they continue to use the current UMTS security context until the re-authentication is initiated. The AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message sent by the network includes the CKSN of the new UMTS security context and is integrity protected with this new context at the GMM layer using a MAC, but remains unciphered. In response, the UE sends an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message that is also integrity protected with the new UMTS security context at the GMM layer by including a MAC, but it too remains unciphered. Following this exchange, both parties adopt the new UMTS security context for use in the LLC layer.","The procedure involves a coordinated effort between the UE and the network to ensure seamless transition from the current to the new UMTS security context during re-authentication. At the outset, integrity protection at the GMM layer is achieved using the new UMTS security context for both the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST and RESPONSE messages. This is done by including a MAC in these messages, although they are sent unciphered. Notably, the LLC layer may also provide an additional layer of integrity protection using the current UMTS security context, if available. Once the re-authentication process is successfully completed, both parties switch to utilizing the new UMTS security context for all further communications at the LLC layer.","A critical aspect of this procedure is the dual-layer approach to integrity protection during the transition phase. At the GMM layer, both the network and UE employ the new UMTS security context to protect the integrity of the authentication and ciphering messages through MAC inclusion, despite these messages being transmitted in an unciphered state. Meanwhile, at the LLC layer, the current UMTS security context may still be used for integrity protection until the re-authentication is finalized.

This is part of the security activation mechanism in the 5G system. After verifying the received message, if the UE finds that it needs to activate UP integrity protection or ciphering but lacks the required keys, it proceeds to generate these keys internally.

Additionally, if there are any associated multicast Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBS) sessions, the UE will locally leave these sessions. The 5GSM cause IE in this message indicates the reason for rejecting the PDU session release, which could be due to PTI already being in use, an invalid PDU session identity, or protocol errors.","When the UE receives a PDU SESSION RELEASE REJECT message from the SMF, it takes several actions. Firstly, it stops timer T3582, which is used to manage the PDU session release procedure. Then, it releases the allocated PTI value and locally releases the PDU session. If there are any multicast MBS sessions associated with this PDU session, the UE will also leave these sessions. The 5GSM cause IE in the message provides insight into why the SMF rejected the PDU session release request. This could be due to a PTI already being in use, indicating that the requested resource is not available. Alternatively, it might be because of an invalid PDU session identity, which suggests a configuration or setup issue. Lastly, protocol errors could also be the reason, highlighting issues with the communication protocols used.","The UE's response to receiving a PDU SESSION RELEASE REJECT message from the SMF involves several key actions and considerations of the reasons provided by the 5GSM cause IE. Initially, the UE stops timer T3582, which is crucial for managing the timing of the PDU session release procedure. Following this, it releases the allocated PTI value, a step that ensures resources are freed up appropriately. The UE then proceeds to locally release the PDU session, effectively ending its participation in that session. If there are any multicast MBS sessions tied to this PDU session, the UE will also take the necessary steps to leave these sessions, ensuring it is no longer a participant. The 5GSM cause IE within the message provides critical feedback on why the SMF chose not to accept the PDU session release request. This could range from PTI already being in use, which might prompt the UE to seek alternative resources or configurations, to an invalid PDU session identity, indicating a need for correction or reconfiguration.

1262,"How does the RAN ensure isolation of resources for data radio bearers when configuring dual connectivity for two redundant PDU sessions with disjoint user plane paths, and what happens if it cannot satisfy this requirement?","The RAN ensures isolation of resources by configuring separate data radio bearers for each redundant PDU session. This is achieved through the use of distinct radio bearer identifiers (RBIDs) for each session, allowing the RAN to manage and allocate resources independently for each session. If the RAN cannot satisfy the disjoint user plane requirement, it may choose to keep or not keep the redundant PDU sessions based on local configuration policies.","To ensure isolation of resources, the RAN employs a combination of logical and physical separation mechanisms when configuring dual connectivity for redundant PDU sessions. This includes allocating separate radio bearers, each with its own set of dedicated resources (e.g., bandwidth, power), to prevent interference or contention between the two sessions. Additionally, the RAN may utilize techniques such as bearer-level Quality of Service (QoS) differentiation and traffic prioritization to further isolate and manage the resources allocated to each session. If the RAN is unable to meet the disjoint user plane requirement, it will typically notify the 5GC, which can then decide whether to maintain or release the redundant PDU sessions based on network policies and available resources.","The RAN ensures resource isolation for data radio bearers in dual connectivity scenarios by leveraging its control over the radio access network (RAN) resources. Specifically, it allocates separate pools of resources (e.g., PRBs, transmission power) to each redundant PDU session, thereby preventing resource overlap or contention between the two sessions. Furthermore, the RAN can utilize advanced radio resource management techniques, such as coordinated multipoint transmission and reception (CoMP), to optimize resource allocation and minimize interference between the two sessions. If the RAN is unable to satisfy the disjoint user plane requirement due to limitations in available resources or network topology, it will typically fall back to a non-redundant PDU session configuration or trigger a handover procedure to an alternative NG-RAN node with more favorable resource availability.",3GPP TS 38.300,16.1.6.1 Redundant user plane paths based on dual connectivity,RAN2,"3GPP Series : 38 , Radio technology beyond LTE"

Specifically, they would specify the exact value of the C-TAG VID field to match, select the desired IP protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP), and choose the appropriate packet direction (either incoming or outgoing). Additionally, since the Ethertype indicates IPv4 payload, the designer can also leverage IP Packet Filter Set capabilities to further refine the filtering criteria.","The network designer would configure the Packet Filter Set by defining a combination of packet filters that match the desired C-TAG VID field value and IP protocol. They would also specify the packet direction to control whether incoming or outgoing packets are filtered. Given that the Ethertype indicates IPv4 payload, the designer can utilize the IP Packet Filter Set feature to filter based on specific IP protocols (e.g., TCP port 80 for HTTP traffic).","In this scenario, the network designer would employ a multi-step approach to configure the Packet Filter Set. First, they would define a filter based on the specific C-TAG VID field value to match. Next, they would create an IP Packet Filter Set that targets the desired IP protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP) and considers the packet direction.

The UE then stores the newly received segment. If all segments are received, the UE assembles the System Information Block 17-Information Elements (SIB17-IEs) from the received segments. However, if the complete SIB17 is not assembled within a certain time period, the UE discards any stored segments for SIB17.","Upon receiving SIB17 with a changed value tag, the UE takes corrective actions to ensure it has the most up-to-date information. It first discards all previously stored segments of SIB17 to prevent any potential conflicts or inconsistencies. Then, it stores the newly received segment. Once all necessary segments are received, the UE proceeds to assemble the complete SIB17-IEs. This process ensures that the UE operates with the latest system information.

Firstly, it sends a CONNECT message to its peer entity in the network. This message signifies the UE's intention to accept the incoming call. Secondly, it starts a timer to monitor and manage the connection establishment process. Finally, upon completing these steps, the UE transitions into the 'connect request' state.","When a mobile terminating call is received, the call control entity in the User Equipment responds by executing a series of coordinated actions to accept the call. The first action involves sending a CONNECT message to the network, which serves as an explicit indication of the UE's willingness to establish the connection.

For downlink QoS flows, the NG-RAN node eliminates duplicated packets to prevent redundant data transmission. In contrast, for uplink QoS flows, the NG-RAN node replicates the packets and transmits them via two separate NG-U tunnels to ensure reliable data transmission.","The NG-RAN node's handling of packet duplication is based on the indicator per QoS flow provided by the 5GC. For downlink QoS flows, this indicator instructs the NG-RAN node to eliminate duplicated packets, ensuring that only one copy of each packet is delivered to the user equipment (UE). Conversely, for uplink QoS flows, the indicator prompts the NG-RAN node to replicate packets and transmit them via two disjointed transport layer paths, thereby guaranteeing reliable data transmission.","The NG-RAN node's approach to handling packet duplication in redundant data transmission scenarios is designed to balance reliability with efficiency.

1630,"What specific conditions must be met for an Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) to allocate a Tracking Area Identity (TAI) list containing multiple tracking areas to a User Equipment (UE), considering factors such as access technology compatibility and geographical area coverage, and how does this allocation impact UE registration and mobility procedures in a 5G network?","For an AMF to allocate a TAI list with multiple tracking areas to a UE, it must ensure that all tracking areas in the list are relevant to the UE's current location and access technology. This means that the AMF must consider factors such as the UE's geographical location, its current access technology, and the compatibility of these factors with the tracking areas in the TAI list. By allocating such a list, the UE considers itself registered to multiple tracking areas and does not need to trigger registration procedures for mobility and periodic registration updates as long as it stays within one of the listed tracking areas.","The AMF can allocate a TAI list containing multiple tracking areas to a UE if it includes only TAIs that are applicable on the access where the TAI list is sent. This means that the AMF must be able to allocate this list over different NG-RAN access technologies, such as 4G or 5G. However, the AMF cannot allocate a TAI list containing both tracking areas in NB-N1 mode and those not in NB-N1 mode. This restriction ensures that the UE receives a consistent set of tracking areas that are compatible with its current access technology. The allocation of such a list has significant implications for UE registration and mobility procedures, as it allows the UE to roam freely within the listed tracking areas without needing to perform frequent registration updates.","When allocating a TAI list containing multiple tracking areas to a UE, the AMF must ensure that at least one entry in the TAI list is provided. If the new and old TAI lists are identical, the AMF does not need to provide the new TAI list during mobility registration updates or periodic registration updates. This optimization reduces signaling overhead and minimizes unnecessary updates. Furthermore, if the UE is deregistered from the 5GS, it must delete the stored TAI list, ensuring that it no longer considers itself registered to those tracking areas. The implications of this allocation on UE registration and mobility procedures are far-reaching, as they enable more efficient and seamless mobility management within the 5G system, allowing for better support of use cases such as IoT and mission-critical communications.",3GPP TS 24.501,5.3.4 Registration areas,CT WG1,"3GPP Series : 24 , Signalling protocols (""stage 3"") - user equipment to network"

Following this, modulation is applied to scrambled bits to produce complex-valued modulation symbols. These symbols are then mapped onto one or several transmission layers. Next, precoding is performed on the complex-valued modulation symbols on each layer to prepare them for transmission via antenna ports. The symbols are subsequently mapped to resource elements for each antenna port. Finally, a complex-valued time-domain OFDM signal is generated for each antenna port.","To generate a downlink physical channel baseband signal, the first step involves scrambling coded bits within each codeword slated for transmission on a specific physical channel. This scrambled data then undergoes modulation to create complex-valued symbols. These symbols are allocated across one or more transmission layers. A precoding operation is applied to these symbols on each layer to adapt them for transmission through multiple antenna ports. The next step involves mapping the precoded symbols onto resource elements, which are specific time-frequency resources within the OFDM grid assigned to each antenna port. Lastly, an OFDM signal in the time domain is generated for each antenna port by transforming the mapped symbols.","The generation of a downlink physical channel baseband signal involves several sequential steps starting with the scrambling of coded bits in each codeword intended for transmission on a particular physical channel.

1648,"How does a receiver determine the type of an unknown information element (IE) in a non-imperative part of a message, based on the first octet containing the IEI, and what are the implications for processing subsequent IEs?","The receiver determines the type of an unknown IE by examining the first octet containing the Information Element Identifier (IEI). If the IEI is not recognized, the receiver checks if it corresponds to a Type 1 or 2 IE (one-octet length) or a Type 4 or 6 IE (length indicator in the next octet or two octets for Type 6). This allows the receiver to skip over unknown IEs and process subsequent ones. The implications are that the receiver can efficiently handle unknown IEs without disrupting message processing.","When encountering an unknown IE, the receiver uses the first octet's IEI to determine its type. If it doesn't match a known IEI, the receiver applies rules to identify whether it's a Type 1/2 or Type 4/6 IE. This distinction is crucial as it dictates how to interpret the subsequent octets (either as part of the IE itself or as a length indicator). By doing so, the receiver can bypass unknown IEs and continue processing the message without errors.","The receiver's approach to handling an unknown IE involves analyzing the first octet's IEI.

This process involves dividing the original RRC message into multiple segments, each carried by a separate RRC PDU. The receiver is responsible for reassembling these segments to reconstruct the complete RRC message. Notably, all segments of an RRC message are transmitted before another RRC message is sent.","In scenarios where the encoded size of an RRC message exceeds the maximum PDCP SDU capacity, the system resorts to segmenting the message. The segmentation process is handled by the RRC layer, which splits the original message into smaller segments. Each segment is then encapsulated within a distinct RRC PDU for transmission. A key aspect of this mechanism is that all segments belonging to an RRC message are transmitted sequentially before initiating the transmission of another RRC message.","The segmentation of RRC messages serves as a critical function when dealing with encoded PDU sizes that exceed the maximum permissible PDCP SDU size. In such cases, the RRC layer undertakes the task of segmenting the message into manageable parts. Each segment is then transmitted within its own RRC PDU, ensuring compliance with the PDCP SDU size constraints.

1934,"What triggers the release of a Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signaling connection in a 5G System, and how do the Access Network (AN) node and the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) determine that the NAS signaling connection has been successfully released?","The release of a NAS signaling connection is triggered by either the AN node or the AMF. When the AN node initiates the release, it may include a list of recommended cells, Tracking Areas (TAs), or NG-RAN node identifiers for paging during the release procedure. The UE considers the NAS signaling connection released if it detects that the AN signaling connection is released. On the other hand, the AMF determines the release by detecting whether the N2 context is released.","In a 5G System, the initiation of releasing a NAS signaling connection can come from two entities: the Access Network (AN) node or the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF). The AN node's decision to release may be influenced by various factors such as network load or UE mobility patterns. Once initiated, the AN node performs a release procedure, which might include providing the AMF with a list of recommended cells or NG-RAN identifiers for future paging purposes. The UE itself monitors the status of its connection to the AN and considers the NAS signaling connection released when it detects that the AN signaling connection is no longer active.","The release of a Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signaling connection in a 5G System is a coordinated process involving both the Access Network (AN) node and the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF). Initiation can be by either entity, reflecting the distributed nature of 5G system architecture. A key aspect of this release process is how each component determines the successful release of the NAS signaling connection. For the UE, this determination is straightforward: it considers the NAS signaling connection released if it detects that its AN signaling connection has been terminated. The AMF, however, relies on a different indicator - it considers the NAS signaling connection released once it detects that the N2 context, which represents the UE's session information within the 5G core network, is no longer active.",3GPP TS 23.501,5.3.3.3.3 NAS signalling connection Release,SA WG2,"3GPP Series : 23 , Technical realization (""stage 2"")"

This allows the network to prioritize requests from different users based on their priority levels.,"The inclusion of the Priority Level information element enables the User Equipment (UE) to request or apply a specific priority level for its communication, which is particularly important in scenarios where multiple UEs are competing for network resources.","From a network perspective, the primary purpose of including the Priority Level information element is to enable efficient resource allocation and traffic management. By knowing the priority level requested or applied by each UE, the network can prioritize traffic accordingly.",3GPP TS 24.008,10.5.1.11 Priority Level,CT WG1,"3GPP Series : 24 , Signalling protocols (""stage 3"") - user equipment to network"
1998,"What is the maximum number of possible entries in each stored list of equivalent Single Network Public Names (SNPNs) that a User Equipment (UE) can store, and under what conditions are these lists created, replaced, or deleted?","The UE can store up to 16 entries in each list of equivalent SNPNs. These lists are created, replaced, or deleted at the end of each registration procedure, specifically when the UE registers for non-emergency services and receives a new list from the network.",The maximum number of possible entries in each stored list of equivalent SNPNs is 16. These lists are dynamically managed by the UE based on network-provided information and registration procedures.,Each stored list of equivalent SNPNs can contain up to 16 entries. These lists are created and managed by the UE in response to registration procedures and network-provided information.,3GPP TS 24.501,5.3.14A List of equivalent SNPNs,CT WG1,"3GPP Series : 24 , Signalling protocols (""stage 3"") - user equipment to network"
1999,What is the primary benefit of maintaining the UE's 5G AS security context during transitions between RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED states?,"The primary benefit is to enable a seamless and secure resumption of the RRC connection, allowing the gNB/ng-eNB and the User Equipment (UE) to reactivate the stored security context, eliminating the need for re-authentication and re-establishment of security parameters.","Maintaining the UE's 5G AS security context during state transitions enables the gNB/ng-eNB to suspend and resume the RRC connection without compromising security, ensuring that the security context remains intact and can be reactivated when the UE reconnects.","By maintaining the UE's 5G AS security context during transitions between RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED states, the gNB/ng-eNB can optimize network resources and reduce signaling overhead, providing faster and more seamless connectivity.",3GPP TS 33.501,6.8.2.1 Security handling at transitions between RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED states 6.8.2.1.1 General,SA WG3,"3GPP Series : 33 , Security aspects"
