# Image Retrieval

Based on user queries, this task involves retrieving the most relevant image from
a database. The dataset consists of <image, query>pairs derived from 3GPP
specification documents, facilitating the evaluation of the modelâ€™s ability to perform accurate image retrieval based on textual descriptions.
The model will be tested on its capacity to understand and match complex technical queries to the most relevant images, enhancing its retrieval accuracy in a domain-specific context. This process leverages detailed textual descriptions paired with corresponding images extracted from 3GPP specification documents. Effective retrieval will be evaluated by comparing model outputs against a ground truth set of <image, query> pairs.
