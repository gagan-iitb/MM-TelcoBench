Restarting UPF sessions (Option 6) is not a targeted solution, and PFCP session modification verification (Option 1) is not directly related to the issue."
 ,Insufficient network coverage causing intermittent signal loss,Timing mismatch between AMF and gNB during PDU session setup,UE configuration error preventing initial session setup,DNS resolution delay causing IP address assignment lag,Misconfigured N2 interface between gNB and AMF leading to intermittent connectivity,UE not sending proper NAS messages during initial registration attempt,['Option 2'],"The logs indicated the initial PDU session resource setup timed out because the gNB did not respond in time to the AMF request. This points to a timing mismatch between the AMF and gNB during the PDU session setup procedure. The resolution involved increasing the AMF timeout and optimizing gNB response performance, confirming the timing issue as the root cause."
Which core network component's periodic failure would most likely cause a complete loss of connectivity for all UEs in a 5G network?,UDM,AMF,NRF,AUSF,PCF,SMF,"['Option 6', 'Option 2']","Both SMF and AMF are critical control plane functions in 5G. The AMF manages mobility and registration, while the SMF handles session management. If either of these functions fails or restarts periodically, it would disrupt all UE sessions since they are responsible for maintaining connectivity for all users."
