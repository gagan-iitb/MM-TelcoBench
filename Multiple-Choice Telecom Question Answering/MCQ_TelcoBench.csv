1993,Under what conditions may the network include the Re-attempt indicator Information Element (IE) in a message?,"When the ESM cause value indicates ""unknown PDN type"" or if the Back-off timer value IE is included and the ESM cause value is not ""insufficient resources"".","Only when the ESM cause value indicates ""PDN type IPv4 only allowed"", ""PDN type IPv6 only allowed"", or ""PDN type non IP only allowed"".","When the network includes the Back-off timer value IE and the ESM cause value is any of #28, #50, #51, #57, #58, #61, or #66.",In all cases where the ESM cause value indicates a PDN type restriction.,Option 1,"The network may include the Re-attempt indicator IE only if specific conditions are met regarding the ESM cause value and the inclusion of the Back-off timer value IE. These conditions ensure that the re-attempt mechanism is triggered under well-defined circumstances, such as unknown PDN types or certain PDN type restrictions, while also considering back-off timers for resource management.",3GPP TS 24.301,8.3.19.4 Re-attempt indicator,CT WG1,"3GPP Series : 24 , Signalling protocols (""stage 3"") - user equipment to network"
1994,What uniquely identifies a resource element in the resource grid for an antenna port?,The complex value of the resource element,"The index pair (k,l) in the frequency and time domains, respectively",The antenna port number,The slot number,Option 2,"A resource element is uniquely identified by its position in the resource grid, which is defined by the index pair (k,l) representing the frequency and time domains. This allows for precise identification and mapping of resource elements within the grid.",3GPP TS 36.211,6.2.2 Resource elements,RAN1,"3GPP Series : 36 , LTE (Evolved UTRA), LTE-Advanced, LTE-Advanced Pro radio technology"
1995,What is the primary purpose of the Access Network Identity in a trusted non-3GPP access network used by the UE to access EPS?,To authenticate the UE's identity,To authorize the UE's access to the EPS,To identify the access network as an input parameter for EPS security procedures,To encrypt data transmission between the UE and the access network,Option 3,"The Access Network Identity is used to identify a trusted non-3GPP access network, which is then used as an input parameter in the EPS security procedures. This ensures that the access network is authenticated and authorized before allowing the UE to access the EPS.",3GPP TS 23.003,19.5 Access Network Identity,CT WG4,"3GPP Series : 23 , Technical realization (""stage 2"")"
1996,What is the primary benefit of the satellite switch with re-sync procedure in a quasi-Earth fixed scenario?,Reduced signaling overhead,Improved handover performance,Avoidance of L3 mobility for UEs in the cell,Enhanced satellite capacity,Option 3,"The satellite switch with re-sync procedure is designed to maintain the same PCI on the geographical area covered by quasi-Earth fixed beam, thereby avoiding L3 mobility for UEs in the cell. This ensures that UEs can continue to communicate seamlessly without experiencing any disruption or change in their connection.",3GPP TS 38.300,16.14.3.2.3 Satellite switch with re-sync,RAN2,"3GPP Series : 38 , Radio technology beyond LTE"
1997,What triggers the measurement of successful Secondary Node Additions without SN terminated bearers in E-UTRAN?,Transmission by the MN of an SgNB reconfiguration complete message to SN after receiving RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message from UE.,"Receipt of SgNB Addition Trigger Indication excluding SN change, inter-eNB HO, intra-eNB HO.",Successful handover between eNodeBs.,Establishment of a new EPS bearer.,Option 1,"The correct answer is Option 1 because the measurement of successful Secondary Node Additions without SN terminated bearers is triggered by the transmission by the MN of an SgNB reconfiguration complete message to SN after receiving RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message from UE, as specified in the text. This indicates that the measurement is taken when the secondary node addition is successfully completed without terminating any bearers on the SN.",3GPP TS 32.425,4.16.1.2 Successful Secondary Node Additions without SN terminated bearers,SA WG5,"3GPP Series : 32 , OAM&P and Charging"
1998,"In a 5G roaming scenario, what is the primary identifier used by the Network Slice within a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) for charging purposes?",S-NSSAI (Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information),IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity),MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number),GUTI (Globally Unique Temporary Identifier),Option 1,"In a 5G roaming scenario, the S-NSSAI is used to identify the Network Slice within a PLMN for charging purposes. This allows the Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN) and Visited Public Land Mobile Network (VPLMN) to collect charging information for retail and wholesale billing, respectively.",3GPP TS 32.240,5.5.3.11 Charging principles for network slice differentiation in 5G roaming,SA WG5,"3GPP Series : 32 , OAM&P and Charging"
1999,What is the primary goal of the SMF Pause of Charging procedure in the 5G System (5GS)?,To reduce the amount of downlink traffic sent to the Access Network (AN),To increase the accuracy of charging and usage monitoring data by reflecting the actual downlink traffic sent to the AN,To pause all PDU Sessions in case of Radio Link Failure,To limit the rate of uplink traffic sent from the UE,Option 2,"The SMF Pause of Charging procedure aims to make the charging and usage monitoring data more accurately reflect the downlink traffic actually sent to the AN. This is achieved by pausing the charging when certain criteria/thresholds are met, such as packet drops at the UPF or Radio Link Failure.",3GPP TS 23.502,4.4.4 SMF Pause of Charging procedure,SA WG2,"3GPP Series : 23 , Technical realization (""stage 2"")"
