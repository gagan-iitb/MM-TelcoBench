# Image Classification 
This task involves the classification of 3GPP images into predefined categories such
as packet structure, network architecture, call ladder/flow diagrams, etc. The
classification task aids in the organization and understanding of visual telecom
data, which is critical for various applications within the domain.
We have defined 5 classes as of now which includes Packet Structure, State Machine Diagram, Network Architetcture, Call Ladder, Flowchart
